        **Note:**

        * This endpoint optionally supports 3DS. To use it, [create](./payment_intents?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_payment_intent) a `payment_intent` and provide it via this endpoint.
        * When the **Remove mandatory add-ons from old plan during subscription plan update** setting is [enabled](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/subscriptions.html#editing-a-subscription_remove-mandatory-addons) on your Chargebee site, all [mandatory addons](./attached_items?prod_cat_ver=2) with the old plan will be automatically removed during the subscription update to a new plan.  
        **Caution**

        If the subscription currently includes [ramp](ramps?prod_cat_ver=2)s, it's important to note that any ramps scheduled may move to the [draft](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/ramps?lang=curl#ramp_status) status due to changes in plan billing frequency, line item, or term end. Carefully review your ramp configurations and the details of the subscription update to prevent any unintended disruptions to the subscription.

        Updates the specified subscription by setting the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided are left unmodified. If an invoice is generated for this operation, any available [credits and excess payments](./customers?prod_cat_ver=2#customer_balances) for the customer are automatically applied.

                    operations.

                    * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit set
                    in Chargebee for backdating subscription change. This limit
                    is the day of the month by which the accounting for the

                    product catalog items of the subscription were changed.

                    * The date is not more than duration X into the past where X
                    is the billing period of the plan. For example, if the
                    period of the plan in the subscription is 2 months and today

                    When `change_option` is set to `specific_date`, then set the
                    date/time at which the subscription change is to happen or
                    has happened. **Note:** It is recommended not to pass this
                    parameter along with `reactivate_from`.
                    `changes_scheduled_at` can be set to a value in the past.
                    This is called backdating the subscription change and is
                    performed when the subscription change has already been
                    provisioned but its billing has been delayed. Backdating is
                    allowed only when the following prerequisites are met:


                    * Backdating must be enabled for subscription change
                    operations.

                    * Only the following changes can be backdated:
                      * Changes in the recurring items or their prices.
                      * Addition of non-recurring items.
                    * Subscription `status` is `active`, `cancelled`, or
                    `non_renewing`.

                    * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit set
                    in Chargebee for backdating subscription change. This limit
                    is typically the day of the month by which the accounting
                    for the previous month must be closed.

                    * The date is on or after `current_term_start`.

                    * The date is on or after the last date/time any of the
                    following changes were made:
                      * Changes in the recurring items or their prices.
                      * Addition of non-recurring items.
                    * The date is not more than duration X into the past where X
                    is the billing period of the plan. For example, if the
                    period of the plan in the subscription is 2 months and today
                    is 14th April, `changes_scheduled_at` cannot be earlier than
                    14th February.

                    **Note:** The `changes_scheduled_at` parameter does not

      summary: Resume a subscription
      description: |
        **Note:** This operation optionally supports 3DS verification flow. To achieve the same, create the [Payment Intent](/docs/api/#3ds-implementation-guide) and pass it as input parameter to this API.

        This API is used to resume a **paused** subscription. On resumption the subscription will be activated and any applicable charges will be initiated.

        You could schedule the resumption by passing **specific_date** parameter in resume_option. If scheduled, the subscription will be resumed on the **specific_date** and moved to Active state.

        For in-term resumption, unless there are scheduled changes, unbilled charges will not be charged.

        **What is an "in-term resumption"?**   
        An "in-term resumption" is when the pause and resumption happens within the billing term of the subscription.

        **Example :** A subscription was billed from 1st to 31st of a month. It was paused on the 20th and resumed before 31st. This is an in-term resumption.

        #### UNPAID INVOICES

        Specifying **unpaid_invoices** allows you to close invoices of the subscription which have amounts due. The invoices are chosen for payment collection after applying the available credits and excess payments.

        If specified as **schedule_payment_collection**, payment collection for the amount due of past invoices will be attempted. The payment method available will be charged if auto-collection is enabled for the customer, and appropriate payment collection(payment succeeded or payment failed) events will be triggered. If the payment collection fails, no further retries will be made on the invoices.

        **Note:** If the invoices of the subscription are consolidated, and any of the subscriptions in the consolidated invoice are cancelled, these invoices will not be selected for collection.  
        **Warning**

        This API will return an error when [multi-frequency billing](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions?lang=curl#subscription-billing-frequencies) is enabled.

      summary: Cancel subscription for items
      description: |
        Cancels the specified subscription.  
        **Warning**

        If there are [ramp](ramps?prod_cat_ver=2)s scheduled for the subscription, this operation deletes any ramps that are set to become effective on or after the subscription's cancellation time.

        #### Canceling contract terms

        * Subscriptions with contract terms can only be canceled by [terminating the contract term](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2&lang=curl#cancel_subscription_for_items_contract_term_cancel_option).
        * When canceling a contract term, the default value for the following parameters is taken from the [site settings for contract terms](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/contract-terms.html#configuring-contract-terms) instead of the [site settings for subscription cancellation](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/cancellations.html#configure-subscription-cancellation).
          * `credit_option_for_current_term_charges`
          * `unbilled_charges_option`
          * `account_receivables_handling`
          * `refundable_credits_handling`
        * From among the parameters for this request, `end_of_term` or `cancel_at` should not be passed when using contract terms; use `contract_term_cancel_option` instead.
        * The `subscription_items` parameter is used to override price or quantity for the termination fee. To use this parameter, the following two conditions must be met:
          * `contract_term_cancel_option` must be set to `terminate_now`.
          * the subscription must have a [subscription_items](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#subscription_subscription_items) attribute with `charge_on_event` set to `contract_term_termination`.

                    backdating when the subscription has been canceled already
                    but its billing has been delayed. The following
                    prerequisites must be met to allow backdating:


                    * Backdating must be enabled for subscription cancellation.

                    * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit set
                    in Chargebee for backdating subscription cancellation. This
                    limit is typically the day of the month by which the
                    accounting for the previous month must be closed.

                    * The date is on or after `current_term_start`.

                    * The date is on or after the last date/time any of the
                    following changes were made:
                      * Changes in the recurring items or their prices.
                      * Addition of non-recurring items.
                    * The date is not more than duration X into the past where X
                    is the billing period of the plan. For example, if the
                    period of the subscription's plan is 2 months and today is
                    14th April, `changes_scheduled_at` cannot be earlier than
                    14th February.

      summary: Regenerate an invoice
      description: |
        Regenerates the current invoice for the subscription. The current invoice is that which includes non-`metered` items from the current term and `metered` items from the previous term of the subscription.  

        #### prerequisites

        * The current invoice of the subscription must have been [voided](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#void_an_invoice) or [deleted](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#delete_an_invoice).
        * The subscription `status` must be `active` or `non_renewing`.
        * There should be no [unbilled charges](/docs/api/unbilled_charges?prod_cat_ver=2) for non-`metered` items for the current term.
        * There should be no [unbilled charges](/docs/api/unbilled_charges?prod_cat_ver=2) for `metered` items for the previous term.
        * The subscription must not have any [advance invoice](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/advance-invoices.html#generating-an-advance-invoice) or [advance invoice schedule](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/advance-invoices.html#generating-an-advance-invoice_setting-up-an-advance-invoicing-schedule).

        #### deleting an invoice

        Usages are also deleted when an invoice is deleted. Therefore, if the invoice was deleted, you may [add](/docs/api/usages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_usage) or [bulk import](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/bulk-operations.html#overview_available-bulk-operations) usages before regenerating an invoice.  
        **Warning**

        This API will return an error when [multi-frequency billing](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions?lang=curl#subscription-billing-frequencies) is enabled.

      summary: Move a subscription
      description: |
        Moves a subscription from one [customer](customers?prod_cat_ver=2) to another asynchronously. All related resources such as [unbilled_charge](unbilled_charges?prod_cat_ver=2), [invoice](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2), [credit_note](credit_notes?prod_cat_ver=2), and [transaction](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2) are also moved to the new customer.

        After moving, Chargebee adds a [comment](comments?prod_cat_ver=2) to the original `customer` resource to document the move, including the [to_customer_id](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#move_a_subscription_to_customer_id) and the `id`s of all the resources transferred to the destination customer.  
        **Warning**

        * If [auto_collection](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items_auto_collection) is `on`, it might fail after this operation. Refer to the warning in [copy_payment_source](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#move_a_subscription_copy_payment_source) for details.
        * During the time that it takes for the operation to complete, no modifications are allowed on the source customer, the destination customer, and the subscription.
        * After moving a subscription, the change does not reflect in Chargebee Billing's [accounting integrations](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/finance-integration-index.html) or in [Chargebee RevRec](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/revrec/chargebee-billing-features.html).
        * This API will return an error when [multi-frequency billing](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions?lang=curl#subscription-billing-frequencies) is enabled.

        #### Prerequisites {#move-prerequisites}

        * The subscription should not be part of a `customer` resource that is within an account hierarchy [relationship](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/customers?lang=curl#customer_relationship).
        * There must be no invoices with the [statuses](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#invoice_status) `payment_due`, `pending`, or `posted` associated with the subscription.
        * The site must have [consolidated invoicing](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/consolidated-invoicing.html) disabled.
        * There should be no consolidated invoices linked to the subscription.
        * No `credit_note` resources with the [statuses](credit_notes?prod_cat_ver=2#credit_note_status) `adjusted` or `refund_due` should be associated with the subscription.
        * The site must have [multi business entity](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/mbe.html) disabled.

        #### Asynchronous operation {#move-async}

        If the above prerequisites are met, the API call returns a `200 OK` response containing the `subscription` resource as is. However, the actual move operation can take up to **five** minutes to complete.

        To know whether the operation was successful, we recommend that you watch for the [subscription_changed](events?prod_cat_ver=2#subscription_changed) event and see if `subscription.customer_id` has changed.

        #### Limitations {#move-limitations}

        * Subscriptions cannot be moved on the same calendar day as their renewal. For instance, if a renewal is scheduled for 2 PM on April 10, 2024, the endpoint is restricted from 12 AM on April 10, 2024, until the renewal is completed.
        * After moving a subscription, the change does not reflect in Chargebee Billing's [accounting integrations](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/finance-integration-index.html) or in [Chargebee RevRec](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/revrec/chargebee-billing-features.html).

        **Note** : Resources linked to the original customer such as `unbilled_charge`, `invoice`, `credit_note`, and `transaction` but **not** linked to the subscription being moved, are **not** moved to the destination customer by this operation.

                    If the subscription has an [associated `payment_source`](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#subscription_payment_source_id):

                    1. A new duplicate copy of the `payment_source` resource is created.
                    2. This new copy of the payment source is linked to the subscription and the destination customer.

                    **Note** : Deleting any copy of the `payment_source` also deletes the other copies and the details stored at the payment gateway.

                    **When `false`:**

                    No new payment source is created for the subscription. Moreover, if a `payment_source` is already [linked](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#subscription_payment_source_id) to the subscription, it gets removed, meaning the `subscription.payment_source_id` is cleared.  
                    **Warning** : When `copy_payment_source` is `false` and if [subscription.auto_collection](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items_auto_collection) is enabled, auto-collection will fail, in turn preventing subscription renewal. To prevent auto-collection failure, [link a payment source](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#override_billing_profile) to the subscription after this operation.

      summary: Remove scheduled cancellation
      description: >
        **Note:** Cannot be called when the subscription is on a [contract
        term](contract_terms). (That is, when the `contract_term.status
        attribute` is `active`.)


        If the subscription is in **Non Renewing** or **In Trial** state and is
        also scheduled to cancel at the end of current term, then this API can
        be used to remove the scheduled cancellation. When a scheduled
        cancellation is removed, the subscription will revert to **Active** or
        **In Trial** state, whichever is the state before cancellation was
        scheduled.


        While removing the scheduled cancellation, you may specify the number of
        billing cycles. If the billing cycle is not specified, the default
        billing cycle from the plan will be applied on the subscription.

      summary: Reactivate a subscription
      description: >
        **Note:** This operation optionally supports 3DS verification flow. To
        achieve the same, create the [Payment
        Intent](/docs/api/#3ds-implementation-guide) and pass it as input
        parameter to this API.


        This API is used to reactivate a **cancelled** subscription. You may
        also optionally specify a trial end date, to move the subscription to
        **In Trial** state. If trial end is not specified, the subscription will
        be activated and any applicable charges will be initiated.


        Unless the billing cycle is specified, it will be set to plan's default
        billing cycle.


        During an in-term reactivation^++^, unless the billing cycle is
        specified, the subscription's remaining billing cycles will be restored.
        If a trial end date is specified, then the plan's default billing cycle
        is used.


        **What is an "in-term reactivation"?**   

        An "in-term reactivation" happens when the billing term of the
        subscription is retained upon cancellation and reactivation is initiated
        within that term.   


        **When is the 'billing term' retained for a cancelled subscription?**   

        When dunning (payment failure retry settings) is configured with the
        last retry configured as


        * cancel subscription and mark invoice as 'Not Paid', or

        * cancel subscription and mark the invoice as 'Voided' and the case if
        any of the current term invoices is partially or fully paid, the invoice
        is not voided but instead Chargebee marks the invoices as 'Not Paid'.




        **Note :** In both cases, the billing term is retained and upon
        reactivation the subscription will be moved to active state (if the plan
        does not have a trial period) and no invoice will be generated. Ensure
        that you collect any unpaid invoices.   


        **Example :** A Subscription was billed from 1st to 31st of a month and
        it was cancelled on the 20th due to one of the above cases (billing term
        is not reset). If the reactivation happens on 25th then it is considered
        an in-term reactivation.

                    When not provided, the subscription is reactivated
                    immediately on calling this API. The value of this parameter
                    must always be in the past (backdating). Do this when the
                    subscription has already been reactivated and the billing
                    has been delayed. The following prerequisites must be met
                    for this parameter to be passed:


                    * The backdating feature has been enabled for subscription
                    reactivation operations.

                    * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit set
                    in Chargebee for backdating such operations. This day is the
                    day of the month by which the accounting for the previous
                    month must be closed.

                    * The date is not more than duration X into the past where X
                    is the billing period of the plan. For example, if the
                    period of the plan in the subscription is 2 months and today
                    is 14th April, `reactivate_from` cannot be earlier than 14th
                    February.

        Changes the subscription's current term end date. Depending on the `status` of the subscription, 'term end date' has different effects.

        * If the subscription is in `trial`, it affects trial end date.
        * If the subscription is `active`, it affects the next billing date.
        * If the subscription is `non_renewing`, this affects the upcoming cancellation date.

        **Tip**

        This API can be used as a way to test subscription renewals and associated webhooks.  
        **Warning**

        This API will return an error when [multi-frequency billing](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions?lang=curl#subscription-billing-frequencies) is enabled.

                    Indicates whether the invoices for this subscription are generated with a `pending` `status`. This attribute is set to `true` automatically when the subscription has item prices that belong to `metered` items.

                    You can also set this to `true` explicitly using the [create](/docs/api/subscriptions#create_subscription_for_items_create_pending_invoices)/[update](/docs/api/subscriptions#update_subscription_for_items_create_pending_invoices) subscription operations. This is useful in the following scenarios:

                    * When tracking usages and calculating usage-based charges on your end. You can then add them to the subscription as a [one-time charge](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/charges.html) at the end of the billing term.
                    * When you need to inspect all charges before closing invoices for this subscription.

                    Applicable only when [Metered Billing](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/metered_billing.html) is enabled for the site

                    If you want to bill the usages from the previous billing cycle, set this parameter to `true`. This is useful if the subscription has moved from another system into Chargebee and you haven't closed the previous cycle's invoice yet. This creates a `pending` invoice immediately on subscription creation, to which you can [add usages](/docs/api/usages#create_a_usage) for the previous cycle.

                    If any non-`metered` items are present for the current term, they're also added to this `pending` invoice. As with all `pending` invoices, this invoice is also [closed automatically](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/metered_billing.html#configuring-metered-billing) or via an [API call](/docs/api/invoices#close_a_pending_invoice).

The legacy credits feature is superseded by [adjustment_credit_notes](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#invoice_adjustment_credit_notes). \* item_level_coupon - The deduction is due to a coupon applied to line item. The coupon `id` is passed as `entity_id`. \* document_level_discount - The deduction is due to a [discount](/docs/api/discounts?prod_cat_ver=2) applied to the invoice `sub_total`. The discount `id` is available as the `entity_id`. \* item_level_discount - The deduction is due to a [discount](/docs/api/discounts?prod_cat_ver=2) applied to a line item of the invoice. The discount `id` is available as the `entity_id`. \* promotional_credits - The deduction is due to a [promotional credit](/docs/api/promotional_credits?prod_cat_ver=2) applied to the invoice.

        Pauses the subscription, changing its `status` to `paused`. This prevents the subscription from getting renewed. No new charges are created until the subscription is resumed.



        #### Note:

        * Applicable only for **active/non-renewing** subscriptions.
        * If paused indefinitely, the subscription is cancelled on the [cancelled_at](/docs/api/subscriptions#subscription_cancelled_at) date.
        * Advance charges, if any, are refunded as credits.

        **Warning**

        * If there are [ramp](ramps?prod_cat_ver=2)s scheduled for the subscription, this operation deletes any ramps that are set to become effective on or after the subscription's pause time.
        * This API will return an error when [multi-frequency billing](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions?lang=curl#subscription-billing-frequencies) is enabled.

      summary: Link a customer to an account hierarchy
      description: >
        Establish a [hierarchical
        relationship](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/account-hierarchy.html)
        between customers. The path parameter `customer_id` identifies the child
        in this relationship.  

        **Prerequisite**


        Both parent and child customers must be part of the same [business
        entity](advanced-features#mbe).  

        **Note**


        * A customer can have a maximum of 250 direct children.

        * The hierarchy allows a maximum of 5 levels from the root node to the
        lowest child node.  

        **Note**


        For the `use_default_hierarchy_settings`, `parent_account_access`, and
        `child_account_access` parameters below, the term "parent" usually
        refers to the customer with the ID
        [payment_owner_id](customers#link_a_customer_payment_owner_id). However,
        if the `payment_owner_id` is the same as the child's ID
        (`{customer_id}`), the "parent" is identified by
        [parent_id](customers#link_a_customer_parent_id).

      summary: Update payment method for a customer
      description: |
        [Payment Sources](/docs/api/payment_sources) comes with additional options and improvements to the [Card APIs](/docs/api/cards). For this operation, use the [Create using temporary token](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_using_temporary_token) API or [Create using permanent token](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_using_permanent_token) API under Payment Sources to update payment method for the customer.

        Updates payment method details for a customer.

        **Note:** If you wish to pass the card number, CVV, or the single-use card tokens provided by gateways like Stripe, then use the [Update card for a customer](cards#update_card_for_a_customer) API under Cards resource. This API is not supported for Chargebee Test Gateway, it is provided to help you understand the billing workflow in Chargebee.

        **PayPal Express Checkout**   
        You can use this API if you are directly integrating PayPal Express Checkout in your website instead of using Chargebee's hosted pages. When your customer updates his payment method using PayPal Express Checkout, you will be provided with the *Billing Agreement ID* by PayPal. You can update the payment method for that customer in Chargebee by passing `type` as `paypal_express_checkout` and `reference_id` with the *Billing Agreement ID*.

        **Login and Pay with Amazon**   
        You can use this API if you are directly integrating *Login and Pay with Amazon* in your website instead of using Chargebee's hosted pages. When your customer updates Amazon as a payment method, you will be provided with the *Billing Agreement ID* by Amazon. You can update the payment method for that customer in Chargebee by passing `type` as `amazon_payments` and `reference_id` with the *Billing Agreement ID*.

        **Card Payments**   
        When the card details of your customer are stored in the vault of gateways such as Stripe or Braintree, you can use this API to update the *reference id* provided by them in Chargebee. To use this API, pass   

        * `type` as `card`.
        * `gateway` with the gateway associated with the card. If the gateway is not specified, the default gateway will be used.
        * `reference_id` with the identifier provided by the gateway/Spreedly to reference that specific card.

        **Reference id format for Card Payments**   
        The format of reference_id will differ based on where the card is stored.  
        **Stripe:** In case of Stripe, the reference_id consists of combination of Stripe Customer ID and Stripe Card ID separated by forward slash (e.g. *cus_63MnDn0t6kfDW7/card_6WjCF20vT9WN1G*). If you are passing Stripe Customer ID alone, then Chargebee will store the card marked as active for that customer in Stripe.

        **Braintree:** In case of Braintree, the reference_id consists of combination of Braintree Customer ID and Braintree Payment Method Token separated by forward slash   
        (e.g. *cus_63MnDn0t6kfDW7/card_6WjCF20vT9WN1G* ). If you are passing Braintree Customer ID alone, then Chargebee will store the card marked as default for that customer in Braintree.

        **Spreedly Card vault:** If the card details are stored in Spreedly vault, then you need to provide the Spreedly token as `reference_id`.

        **Direct Debit Payments**   
        When the bank account details of your customer are stored in the gateway vault, you can use this API to update the reference id provided by them in Chargebee. To use this API, pass   

        * `type` as `direct_debit`.
        * `gateway` with the gateway where the bank account details are stored (e.g. *authorize_net*). If the gateway is not specified, the gateway supporting the direct debit will be used.
        * `reference_id` with the identifier provided by the gateway to reference the customer's bank account details.
        * `tmp_token` with the single use token provided by the gateway ( Should be passed only if reference_id is not passed ).

        **Reference id format for Direct Debit Payments**   
        The format of reference_id will differ based on where the bank account is stored.  
        **Stripe:** In case of Stripe, the reference_id consists of combination of Stripe Customer ID and Stripe Bank Account ID separated by forward slash   
        (e.g. *cus_8suoHaLQH4G5AW/ba_18b8z2KmcbENlhgU03RznRYW*). If you are passing Stripe Customer ID alone, then Chargebee will store the first bank account details present in payment profile list of that customer in Stripe.

        **Authorize.Net:** The reference_id consists of combination of Authorize.Net's Customer Profile ID and Payment Profile ID separated by forward slash (e.g. *2384383/34834382*). If you are passing Authorize.Net's Customer Profile ID alone, then Chargebee will store the first bank account details present in payment profile list of that customer in Authorize.Net.

        **GoCardless:** The reference_id is the GoCardless Customer Mandate ID (e.g. *MD0077Z99TTQXK*).

        **Note:** While using this API to update payment method details, [Card Verification](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/cards.html#card-verification) will not happen even if it is enabled for that particular gateway.

      summary: Create a customer
      description: |
        **Note:** This operation optionally supports 3DS verification flow. To achieve the same, create the [Payment Intent](/docs/api/3ds_card_payments?prod_cat_ver=1) and pass it as input parameter to this API.

        Creates a customer. You can create a customer and then create subscriptions for the customer when required. When creating a customer, you can pass along the billing address, card details, and any [custom attributes](advanced-features?prod_cat_ver=2#custom_fields).

        Passing raw card data via API involves PCI liability at your end due to the sensitivity of the data. Instead, you can use one of the following integration options as applicable:

        Here's some resources you can use to collect card information within your checkout form based on the payment gateway you use:

        * [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js) for Stripe users.
        * [Braintree.js](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/client-sdk/setup/javascript/v2) for Braintree users.
        * [Accept.js](https://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/acceptjs.html), if you use [Authorize.Net](https://www.authorize.net/).
        * If you are using the Adyen gateway, you will have to use the Adyen's [Client-Side Encryption](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/classic-integrations/api-integration-ecommerce/cse-integration-ecommerce) to encrypt sensitive cardholder data. Once the cardholder data is encrypted, pass the value in `adyen.encrypted.data`as temp token in this API.
        * You can also use our [Hosted Pages](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/1.0/hosted_pages.html) based integration.

        When billing address is not passed (say, for customers making offline payments), you can always provide it later using the [Update billing info for a customer API](/docs/api/customers#update_billing_info_for_a_customer).

        **Note:**When an invoice is generated for a customer, the billing address provided for the customer is stored with the invoice. If the First Name, Last Name, and Company fields of the billing address do not contain any information, they're picked up from the customer details.

                    When you have enabled [EU VAT](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/eu-vat.html) in 2021 or have [manually
                    enabled](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/brexit.html#what-needs-to-be-done-in-chargebee) the Brexit configuration, you have the option of setting [billing_address](customers#customer_billing_address) `country` as `XI`. That's the code for **United Kingdom - Northern
                    Ireland** . The first two characters of the VAT number in such a case is `XI` by default. However, if the VAT number was registered in UK, the value should be `GB`. Set `vat_number_prefix` to `GB` for such cases.

The value must be from the list of possible values and must correspond to the country provided under `billing_address.country`.

                    **Tip:**


                    If there are additional entity identifiers for the customer not associated with the `vat_number`, they can be provided as the `entity_identifiers[]` array.

      summary: Collect payment for customer
      description: >
        **Note:** This operation optionally supports 3DS verification flow. To
        achieve the same, create the [Payment
        Intent](/docs/api/#3ds_card_payments) and pass it as input parameter to
        this API.


        This API can be used to collect the payments for customer's
        **payment_due** and **not_paid** invoices. You can either choose to
        collect the payment from an existing payment source or a new payment
        source. You can choose to either retain or discard the new payment
        source, which is being used for payment. If the amount collected exceeds
        the invoice amount, the surplus will be counted in as excess payments.

      summary: Update account hierarchy access settings for a customer
      description: >
        When the customer is part of an [account
        hierarchy](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/account-hierarchy.html), this
        operation updates the access privileges that both the customer and its
        parent have to the customer's data.  

        **Terminology**


        The term "parent" usually refers to the customer with the ID
        [payment_owner_id](customers#customer_relationship_payment_owner_id).
        However, if the `payment_owner_id` is the same as the child's ID (given
        by the path parameter), the "parent" is identified by
        [parent_id](customers#customer_relationship_parent_id).  

        **Tip**


        You cannot use this endpoint to change the `parent_id`,
        `invoice_owner_id` or `payment_owner_id` for the customer. To change
        them, [unlink the customer](customers#delink_a_customer) and then call
        [Link a customer](customers?prod_cat_ver=2#link_a_customer) with the
        updated values.

      summary: Update billing info for a customer
      description: >
        This method is used for updating the `billing_address` and `vat_number`
        attributes of the `customer`. For updating the other customer attributes
        use [Update Customer API](customers#update_a_customer).


        During this operation, if `billing_address` and `vat_number` are not
        already present, they're added. Whereas if present, the existing values
        are replaced with the new values passed. The only exception here is for
        `entity_identifiers[i]` when `entity_identifiers[operation][i]` is
        passed as `delete`.


        **Note:**When an invoice is generated for a customer, the billing
        address provided for the customer will be stored with the invoice. If
        the First Name, Last Name, and Company fields do not contain any
        information under Billing Info, the same will be picked from Customer
        Details if the same is available there.Please ensure that the VAT number
        is provided whenever the billing address is updated, as failing to do so
        will override any existing VAT numbers if new values are not provided.

                    Ireland** . The first two characters of the VAT number in such a case is `XI` by default. However, if the VAT number was registered in UK, the value should be `GB`. Set `vat_number_prefix` to `GB` for such cases.

        #### deprecated


        The [Payment Sources API](/docs/api/payment_sources), with its
        additional options and improvements, obsoletes the Cards APIs. This
        request is obsoleted by the [Export payment source
        API](/docs/api/payment_sources#export_payment_source).


        Copies the customer's card information to another payment gateway. This
        is useful if you want to port your customer's card details to another
        gateway.


        **Limitation**   

        This request does not support copying of cards between Braintree and
        Stripe payment gateways. Contact [Chargebee
        Support](https://chargebee.freshdesk.com/support/home) to perform those
        actions.

        The [Payment Sources API](/docs/api/payment_sources), with its
        additional options and improvements, obsoletes the Cards APIs. This
        request is obsoleted by the [Delete a payment source
        API](/docs/api/payment_sources#delete_a_payment_source).


        Deletes the card for a customer. Upon successful deletion the
        `auto_collection` attribute for the customer is set to `off` and a
        `card_deleted` event is triggered. If there is no card found at the
        gateway for the customer, this API returns without errors.

      summary: Update card for a customer
      description: |
        #### Deprecated

        The [Payment Sources API](/docs/api/payment_sources), with its additional options and improvements, obsoletes the [Cards APIs](/docs/api/cards). This operation is obsoleted by the following:

        * [Create using temporary token](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_using_temporary_token)
        * [Create using permanent token](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_using_permanent_token)
        * [Create a card payment source](/docs/api/payment_sources#create_a_card_payment_source)

        Adds or replaces card details of a customer. Updating card details replaces the present payment method.

        Passing credit card details to this API involves PCI liability at your end as sensitive card info passes through your servers. If you wish to avoid that, you can use one of the following integration methodologies if applicable

        * If you are using Stripe gateway, you can use [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js) with your card update form.
        * If you are using Braintree gateway, you can use [Braintree.js](https://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/javascript) with your card update form.
        * If you are using Authorize.Net gateway, you use [Accept.js](https://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/acceptjs.html) with your card update form.
        * In case you are using the Adyen gateway, you will have to use the Adyen's [Client Side Encryption](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/classic-integrations/api-integration-ecommerce/cse-integration-ecommerce) to encrypt sensitive cardholder data. Once the cardholder data is encrypted, pass the value in adyen.encrypted.data as temp token in this API.
        * You can also use our [Hosted Pages](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/hosted_pages.html) based integration. Use our [Hosted Page - Update Card](/docs/api/hosted_pages#update_card) API to generate a 'Update Card' Hosted Page link.



        **Legacy behavior:**

      summary: Subscription renewal estimate
      description: >
        This returns an estimate of the amount that will be charged when the
        subscription is billed next. The estimate is calculated based on the
        current recurring items of the subscription - plan, addons, and coupons.


        In the response,


        * **estimate.subscription_estimate** has the current subscription
        details like its status, next billing date, and so on.

        * **estimate.invoice_estimate** has details of the invoice that will be
        generated at the next billing date.

          The generated invoice estimate will include all the balances - [Promotional Credits](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/promotional-credits.html), Refundable Credits, and Excess Payments - if any. If you don't want these balances to be included you can specify 'false' for the parameter *use_existing_balances*.

          To exclude the [delayed charges](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/charges.html) from the invoice estimate, specify 'false' for the parameter *include_delayed_charges*.

        **Note:**


        * This API will not generate a renewal invoice if an [advance
        invoice](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/advance-invoices.html) is
        already present for the subscription.

        * For 'Non Renewing' subscriptions, only the [delayed
        charges](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/charges.html) will be included
        in the invoice estimate.

        * This API is not supported for 'Cancelled' subscriptions.

        * Only the subscription's charges will be included. If you have enabled
        the Consolidated invoicing feature, use the *Upcoming Invoices* estimate
        available for the Customer object to get the actual estimate invoice for
        the customer.

                    backdating when the subscription has been canceled already
                    but its billing has been delayed. The following
                    prerequisites must be met to allow backdating:


                    * Backdating must be enabled for subscription cancellation.

                    * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit set
                    in Chargebee for backdating subscription cancellation. This
                    limit is typically the day of the month by which the
                    accounting for the previous month must be closed.

                    * The date is on or after `current_term_start`.

                    * The date is on or after the last date/time any of the
                    following changes were made:
                      * Changes in the recurring items or their prices.
                      * Addition of non-recurring items.
                    * The date is not more than duration X into the past where X
                    is the billing period of the plan. For example, if the
                    period of the subscription's plan is 2 months and today is
                    14th April, `changes_scheduled_at` cannot be earlier than
                    14th February.

      summary: Resume subscription estimate
      description: >
        Generates an estimate for the 'resume subscription' operation. This is
        similar to the [Resume a
        subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions#resume_a_subscription) API, but
        the subscription will not be resumed. Only an estimate for this
        operation is created.


        In the response,


        * **estimate.subscription_estimate** has the subscription details.

        * **estimate.invoice_estimate** has details of the invoice that will be
        generated immediately. This will not be present if no immediate invoice
        is generated for this operation. This will happen for in-term
        resumption^++^.   

          **^++^What is an "in-term resumption"?**   
          An "in-term resumption" is when the resumption happens within the billing term of the subscription.
        * **estimate.next_invoice_estimate** has details of the invoice that
        will be generated during the next billing date of this subscription.
        This will be present only if no immediate invoice is generated during
        this operation (scenario mentioned above) and this subscription has next
        billing.   

          The generated invoice_estimate/next_invoice_estimate will include all the balances - [Promotional Credits](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/promotional-credits.html), Refundable Credits, and Excess Payments - if any.

      summary: Regenerate Invoice Estimate
      description: >+
        Regenerates the invoice for the current term of the subscription. The
        subscription must have `status` as `active` or `non_renewing`. This
        operation is not allowed when any of the following conditions hold true
        for the subscription:


        * An invoice exists for the current term and its `status` is not
        `voided`.

        * There are [unbilled
        charges](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/unbilled-charges.html) for the
        current term.

        * The subscription has an [advance
        invoice](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/advance-invoices.html).




        #### Response


        Returns an `estimate` object with one of the following components
        depending on the value of `invoice_immediately`.


        * If the value is `true`: an `invoice_estimate` object that corresponds
        to the regenerated invoice.

        * If the value is `false`: a list of `unbilled_charge_estimate` objects
        corresponding to all the unbilled charges created for the current term
        of the subscription.

                        operations.

                        * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit
                        set in Chargebee for backdating such operations. This
                        day is typically the day of the month by which the
                        accounting for the previous month must be closed.

                        * The date is not more than duration X into the past,
                        where X is the billing period of the plan. For example,
                        if the period of the plan in the subscription is 2
                        months and today is 14th April, `start_date` cannot be

        In the response,


        * **estimate.subscription_estimate** has the subscription details like
        the status of the subscription (in_trial, active, etc.), next billing
        date, and so on.

        * **estimate.invoice_estimate** has details of the invoice that will be
        generated immediately. This will not be present if no immediate invoice
        is generated for this operation. This will happen when
          * *prorate* parameter is false, or
          * *invoice_immediately* parameter is false, or
          * subscription is in *in-trial* state
        * **estimate.credit_note_estimates\[\]** has details of the credit-notes
        that will get generated during this operation. This list will be empty
        if no credit-note gets generated during this operation.

        * **estimate.unbilled_charge_estimates\[\]** has details of the unbilled
        charges. This is returned only if *invoice_immediately* is set as false.

      summary: Pause subscription estimate
      description: |
        This API provides an estimate of the details pertaining to the [pause_subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions#pause_a_subscription) operation. It returns attributes such as [pause_date](/docs/api/estimates#estimate_subscription_estimate_pause_date) and [resume_date](/docs/api/estimates#estimate_subscription_estimate_resume_date). This is similar to the [Pause a subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions#pause_a_subscription) API with the exception that the subscription is not paused. Only an estimate for this operation is created.

        In the response,

        * **estimate.subscription_estimate** has the subscription details.
        * **estimate.invoice_estimate** has details of the invoice that are generated immediately. This is not present if no immediate invoices are generated for this operation.
        * **estimate.credit_note_estimates\[\]** has details of the credit notes that are generated during this operation. This list is empty if no credit notes are generated.

                        has started. If not provided, the subscription starts
                        immediately on quote conversion. The quote can be
                        converted on a date/time after this date. This is called
                        backdating the subscription creation and is done when
                        the subscription has already been provisioned but the
                        conversion action has been delayed. Backdating is
                        allowed only when the following prerequisites are met:


                        * Backdating is enabled for subscription creation
                        operations.

                        * The current day of the month does not exceed the limit
                        set in Chargebee for backdating such operations. This
                        day is typically the day of the month by which the
                        accounting for the previous month must be closed.

                        * The date is not more than duration X into the past
                        where X is the billing period of the plan. For example,
                        if the period of the plan in the subscription is 2
                        months and today is 14th April,
                        `subscription[start_date]` cannot be earlier than 14th
                        February.

        **Disabled by default**


        This endpoint is disabled by default. To enable it, contact [Chargebee
        Support](https://support.chargebee.com).


        Retrieves a list of all `customer_entitlement` objects for the specified
        customer.  

        **Tip**


        To retrieve subscription entitlements for a specific subscription, use
        the [List subscription entitlements
        API](subscription_entitlements#list_subscription_entitlements).  


        ### Pagination {#pagination}


        [Pagination](list-ops#pagination) works differently for this endpoint
        than other List endpoints in the Billing API. In other list endpoints,
        the `limit` parameter sets the limit on the total number of objects
        returned in the response. However, in this endpoint, the `limit`
        parameter defines the number of features for which the
        `customer_entitlement` objects are returned. For example, if `limit` =
        n, then all `customer_entitlement` objects for up to n features are
        returned.


        Let's look at an example:


        #### Features {#foo1}


        Consider the following three features defined in Chargebee for a project
        management software:


        * User Licenses

        * Support Level

        * Xero Integration


        The `feature` objects are listed below:


        ##### Feature 1


        `

        {

        "feature": {

        "id": "user-licenses",

        "value": "3",

        "is_unlimited": false,

        "level": 1

        },

        {

        "name": "10 licences",

        "value": "10",

        "is_unlimited": false,

        "level": 2

        },

        {

        "name": "25 licences",

        "value": "25",

        "is_unlimited": false,

        "level": 3

        },

        {

        "level": 4

        }

        ],

        "object": "feature"

        }

        }

        `


        ##### Feature 2


        `

        {

        "feature": {

        "id": "support-level",

        "name": "Support Level",

        "description": "Level of support offered.",

        "status": "active",

        "type": "custom",

        "levels": [

        "level": 1

        },

        {

        "name": "Chat",

        "value": "Chat",

        "is_unlimited": false,

        "level": 2

        },

        {

        "name": "Calls",

        "value": "Calls",

        "is_unlimited": false,

        "level": 3

        }

        ],

        "object": "feature"

        }

        }

        `


        ##### Feature 3


        `

        {

        "feature": {

        "id": "xero-integration",

        "name": "Xero Integration",

        "description": "Integrate your Chargebee site with Xero",

        "status": "active",

        "type": "switch",

        "object": "feature"

        }

        }

        `


        ##### Subscriptions


        Now consider that a customer `c1` has two subscriptions: `s1` and `s2`.


        ##### Subscription entitlements


        Consider the following subscription entitlements for `s1` and `s2`:


        | Subscription id |    Feature Name    | Entitlement Value |

        |-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|

        | `s1`            | `User Licenses`    | `3`               |

        | `s1`            | `Support Level`    | `Email`           |

        | `s2`            | `User Licenses`    | `10`              |

        | `s2`            | `Support Level`    | `Chat`            |

        | `s2`            | `Xero Integration` | `true`            |


        ##### API responses


        API calls to this endpoint work as follows:


        ###### First call


        Consider the first call with `limit` set to `2`.  

        `

        GET /api/v2/customers/c1/customer_entitlements?limit=2

        `


        ###### Response


        `

        {

        "list": [

        {

        "customer_entitlement": {

        "customer_id": "c1",

        "subscription_id": "s1",

        "feature_id": "user-licenses",

        "value": "3",

        "name": "3 licences",

        "is_enabled": true,

        "object": "customer_entitlement"

        }

        },

        {

        "customer_entitlement": {

        "customer_id": "c1",

        "subscription_id": "s2",

        "feature_id": "xero-integration",

        "value": "true",

        "name": "Available",

        "is_enabled": true,

        "object": "customer_entitlement"

        }

        },

        {

        "customer_entitlement": {

        "customer_id": "c1",

        "subscription_id": "s2",

        "feature_id": "user-licenses",

        "value": "10",

        "name": "10 licences",

        "is_enabled": true,

        "object": "customer_entitlement"

        }

        }

        ],

        "next_offset": "2"

        }

        `


        Since `limit` = `2`, the API returns the `customer_entitlement` for two
        features: **User Licenses** and **Xero Integration**. Three objects are
        returned, corresponding to rows 1, 3, and 5 in the table above.


        ###### Second call


        We now retrieve the next page of the list in the second call by setting
        `offset` to the value of `next_offset` obtained from the previous
        response.  

        `

        GET /api/v2/customers/c1/customer_entitlements?limit=2&offset=2

        `


        ###### Response


        `

        {

        "list": [

        {

        "customer_entitlement": {

        "customer_id": "c1",

        "subscription_id": "s1",

        "feature_id": "support-level",

        "value": "Email",

        "name": "Email",

        "is_enabled": true,

        "object": "customer_entitlement"

        }

        },

        {

        "customer_entitlement": {

        "customer_id": "c1",

        "subscription_id": "s2",

        "feature_id": "support-level",

        "value": "Chat",

        "name": "Chat",

        "is_enabled": true,

        "object": "customer_entitlement"

        }

        }

        ]

        }

        `


        Although `limit` = `2`, the `customer_entitlement` objects for only one
        more feature, namely, Support Level are returned because the remaining
        were covered in the previous page. No more `customer_entitlement`
        objects remain for the customer, as indicated by the absence of the
        `next_offset` attribute in the response. The returned objects in this
        last call correspond to rows 2 and 4 in the table above.

        at any given time, excluding deleted ramps.

        * You cannot create a ramp for subscription, when ramps are in draft
        status.

            intent which is passed has authorized 10$ and if the charges
            initiated is for 12$. \* \`configuration_incompatible\` - Returned
            when the request is not compatible with the configuration for the
            site or the configuration is incomplete. \*
            \`payment_intent_invalid\` - Returned when validation or
            verification fails for provided payment intent.For example if
            payment intent which is passed is in not consumable state. \*
            \`invalid_request\` - Returned when the request has incompatible
            values or does not match the API specification. As it is a generic
            error, handling this error is recommended only in combination with
            param attribute. \* \`payment_method_verification_failed\` -
            Returned when validation or verification fails for the provided
            payment method. For example if the payment method is card, this will
            include all card parameter validation errors and also verification
            failures from the gateway. \* \`payment_processing_failed\` -
            Returned when the payment collection fails. \*
            \`resource_limit_exhausted\` - Returned when any limit constraint is
            violated by the request. For example this error is thrown when the
            coupon provided has already expired or its maximum redemption count
            has been reached. \* \`duplicate_entry\` - Returned when the request
            provides a duplicate value for an attribute that is specified as
            unique for that site. For example in 'create subscription api' if
            you are passing the subscription id then this error will be thrown
            if a subscription exists in site with the same id. \*
            \`param_wrong_value\` - Returned when the value does not meet the
            required specification for the parameter. For example, wrong email
            format. It is strongly recommended to do the validation at your end
            before calling Chargebee's API (other than specific cases like VAT
            number validation). \* \`payment_method_not_present\` - Returned
            when the request requires payment collection but the 'payment
            method' details (such as card) is not present for the customer. This
            error will not occur if auto-collection is disabled for the
            customer. \* \`resource_limit_exceeded\` \*
            \`payment_gateway_currency_incompatible\` - Returned when the
            payment gateway configured is incompatible with the transactional
            currency. This error will not occur if auto-collection is disabled
            for the customer.

        The invoice for a subscription in Chargebee is generated at the time of subscription renewal. Invoices can also be [generated in advance](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/advance-invoices.html) for an upcoming renewal or set of renewals. With Advance Invoicing Schedules, you can set up a plan for when such advance invoices are generated for the lifetime of the subscription. This helps you:

        * Set up a contract with your customers so that they can be notified of their payment schedules in advance.
        * Allow customers who make offline payments to be alerted about their upcoming dues well ahead of actual subscription renewals.
        * Prevent post-renewal unpaid usage of your services by customers.

        Advance invoices can be scheduled in two ways:  

        #### Specific Dates Schedule

        Advance invoices for a subscription can be scheduled to be generated on specific [dates](advance_invoice_schedules#advance_invoice_schedule_specific_dates_schedule_date) in the future. You must specify the [number of billing cycles](advance_invoice_schedules#advance_invoice_schedule_specific_dates_schedule_terms_to_charge) to be invoiced on each date. A maximum of 5 dates can be specified.  

        #### Fixed Interval Schedule

        Advance invoices can be scheduled to be generated at fixed intervals of time, where each interval spans the same number of billing cycles of the subscription. The invoice for each interval is generated a specified number of days ([`days_before_interval`](advance_invoice_schedules#advance_invoice_schedule_fixed_interval_schedule_days_before_renewal)) before the start of the interval. You can configure the schedule to end on a certain date or after a specified number of advance invoices have been generated.

        The start date of the first interval depends on the number of days remaining from current time till the next renewal of the subscription. If this is more than `days_before_interval`, the interval begins at the next renewal. On the other hand, if the number of days remaining before the next renewal is less than `days_before_interval`, the first interval begins at the renewal following the next.

        Addon-item and charge-item prices are purchased with plan-item prices in subscriptions. You can automate this process by configuring certain addons and charges as "attached" to certain plans. This is done at the "item" level. In other words, addon- and charge-items can be attached to plan-items.

        Once the attachment is defined, while creating or updating a subscription, the addon- or charge-item prices are selected automatically based on the plan-item price selected . Let's look at the details:

        ### Addons

        Addons can be attached to plans as `recommended`, `mandatory` or `optional`.

        * When an addon is attached as `recommended` for a plan, the addon is suggested to be applied to subscriptions for the plan in [Checkout](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/configure-inapp.html#fundamental-settings_recommending-addons-in-checkout) and [Self-Serve Portal](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/inapp-self-serve-portal.html#allow-change-subscription). Alternatively, if you build your own payment pages or have a sales team, you can suggest recommended addons to your customers or salespeople on your website or CRM respectively
        * When an addon is attached as `mandatory` for a plan, the addon gets applied to subscriptions for the plan compulsorily, unless [removed explicitly](./subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2). If you do not pass an item price for a mandatory addon when including the plan in a subscription, an addon-item price is automatically applied as explained below.
        * Attaching an addon as `optional` neither marks it as recommended or mandatory but allows you a way to set a `quantity` and `billing_cycles` for the addon, for when it is applied to subscriptions with the plan.

        How auto-selection of the addon-item price works
        ------------------------------------------------

        Once an addon has been attached as mandatory, the addon-item price to be applied to the plan-item price is selected based on the following rule: The addon-item price with the same currency as that of the plan-item price and the longest compatible period is selected.

        Here's an example:

        Consider a plan **Standard Cloud Storage** has an addon **Extra Storage** attached to it. Note that each of the two are items. Now consider that they have item prices with the following periods and currencies:

        **Item price for "Standard Cloud Storage" plan-item:**

        * Standard Cloud Storage, 3 years, AUD.

        **Item prices for "Extra Storage" addon-item:**

        * Extra Storage, 1 year, EUR.
        * Extra Storage, 1 year, USD.
        * Extra Storage, 1 year, AUD.
        * Extra Storage, 18 months, AUD.
        * Extra Storage, 2 years, AUD.
        * Extra Storage, 30 months, AUD.

        For the plan-item price (Standard Cloud Storage, 3 years, AUD), the addon-item prices with matching currencies are the last 4 from the above list:

        * Extra Storage, 1 year, AUD.
        * Extra Storage, 18 months, AUD.
        * Extra Storage, 2 years, AUD.
        * Extra Storage, 30 months, AUD.

        From among them, the last two have periods that are incompatible with the plan-item price period of 3 years. From the remaining 2 addon-item prices, the one with the longest period is of 18 months. So, "Extra Storage, 18 months, AUD" is selected for mandatory application to the plan item price.

        ### Charges

        Charges can also be attached to plans. When doing so, you specify [the event](./attached_items?prod_cat_ver=2#attached_item_charge_on_event) at which the charge is to be applied to the subscription. For some events that can occur multiple times in a subscription lifetime, you can also set whether to apply the charge each time the event occurs or just once.

        There may be multiple item prices for a given attached charge. The item price that matches the currency of the plan-item price is automatically selected for application.

        Here's an example:

        Consider a plan **Standard Cloud Storage** has a charge named **Implementation Fee** attached to it. Now consider their item prices below, with the following periods and currencies:

        **Item price for "Standard Cloud Storage" plan-item:**

        * Standard Cloud Storage, 3 years, AUD.

        **Item prices for "Implementation Fee" charge-item:**

        * Implementation Fee, USD.
        * Implementation Fee, AUD.
        * Implementation Fee, EUR.

        From among the charge-item prices above, the one compatible with the plan-item price is "Implementation Fee, AUD" since it has the same currency as the plan-item price.

        The `business_entity` resource represents a business unit or brand under your organization. Key resources in Chargebee Billing (such as [customer](customers?prod_cat_ver=2), [subscriptions](subcriptions?prod_cat_ver=2), [invoices](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2), and [transactions](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2)) along with the associated site configurations, fall under a [business entity](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/mbe.html). Each Chargebee Billing [site](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/sites-intro.html) has one business entity by default. You may create multiple business entities in the following scenarios:

        * **Multiple Business Units**: You may be running your business under different regional units with different "invoice-from" addresses. This is usually done to manage taxation and bookkeeping. In such a case, you may create a business entity for each business unit.
        * **Multiple Brands**: You may have multiple brands within your business, such as those acquired via mergers and acquisitions. You may create a business entity for each brand.

        Creating multiple business entities lets you separate configuration and data for your business units or brands so that you can manage their billing and revenue operations independently.

        Specifying business entity in API operations {#mbe-header}
        ----------------------------------------------------------

        All API operations in Chargebee have site [context](#mbe-context). Context restrictions cannot be assigned to [API keys](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/api_keys.html). However, if your site has multiple business entities, you can specify the business entity [context](#mbe-context) for an API call by passing a [custom HTTP request header](advanced-features#mbe-header).  

        API behavior based on business entity specified {#mbe-operations}

        The table below explains how Chargebee responds to various API calls depending on whether the business entity ID is specified as part of the API call.

        Terminology {#mbe-terms}
        ------------------------

        This section defines some useful terms for describing how business entities work.

        #### Linked business entity {#mbe-linked-be}

        Any resource is always associated with precisely one and only one business entity. We call it the linked business entity of the resource, or simply, the business entity of the resource.

        #### Default business entity {#mbe-default-be}

        When `customer` resource is created and no business entity is specified, it is linked to the business entity designated as the default business entity of the site. A site always has a default business entity. At first, it is the same as the first business entity of the site and can be changed once more business entities are created. [Contact Support](https://support.chargebee.com/support/home) to change the default business entity.

        #### Context of an operation {#mbe-context}

        Any site has data in it. This includes all the various resources such as customers, subscriptions, invoices, comments, and so on. The "context" of an API operation is the subset of site data it has access to. An API operation can only read or write data within its context. By default, an API operation has "site context", which means it has access to the entire site's data. However, when a business entity is [specified](#mbe-header) in an API operation, it has "business entity context", which means that the operation only has access to the data linked to the business entity.  
        **Example**

        Consider the [List customers API](customers?prod_cat_ver=2#list_customers). When you call the API without specifying a business entity, its context is that of the site and therefore returns customer resources for the entire site. However, when you specify a business entity, the context is only that of the business entity, and therefore the customer resources of only the selected business entity are returned.

        Let's look at the [Create checkout for a new subscription API](hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_checkout_for_a_new_subscription). Say you're calling this API and providing the `customer[id]` parameter. When no business entity is specified, the operation has *site context* and therefore looks up the ID among all the customer resources in the site. However, when a business entity is provided, the operation has *business entity context* and looks up the ID only among the customers linked to that business entity.

        #### Target resource {#mbe-target}

        While creating an API resource other than a `customer`, you specify a target resource under which it should be created. For example:

        * While [creating an `invoice` resource for a one-time charge](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges), you must specify either the `customer` or the `subscription` resource to which it belongs. The `customer` or `subscription` resource, in this case, is the target resource of the `invoice`.
        * While [creating a `subscription`](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items), the target resource of a `subscription` resource is always a `customer` resource.
        * While [creating a `quote` resource of `type` `change_subscription`](quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_update_subscription_items), the target resource is a `subscription` resource.

        Comments are additional information that you can add to your resources.
        Comments can be added to provide context for any operation that was
        performed.


        When you make an API call on any resource, for example, Subscriptions
        -\> Change term end, you can add more context to that operation by
        calling the comments API as a follow up call.


        Besides the user generated comments, Chargebee also generates "System"
        comments when a change for a resource happens at the backend. These
        comments are all read-only.

        Subscriptions can run indefinitely or they may run for a fixed number of billing cycles. Subscription can have "contract terms", which define a lock-in period on the subscription for a certain number of billing cycles. This prevents the subscription from being canceled by the customer when it is within the contract term.

        The **contract term** resource described below defines the properties of this lock-in period. This includes the [number of billing cycles](contract_terms#contract_term_remaining_billing_cycles), the [total contract value](contract_terms#contract_term_total_contract_value), the [action to be taken](contract_terms#contract_term_action_at_term_end) at the end of the contract term, and so on. To allow for exceptions, you also have the option of terminating an [`active`](contract_terms#contract_term_status) contract term and charging a [termination fee](contract_terms#termintation_fee).

        A contract term starts in the `active` state and ends in the `completed` state. If the contract was canceled due to non-payment or other reasons, it can end in the `canceled` or `terminated` state. A given contract term is always associated with one, and only one subscription. A subscription, however, can be associated with only one `active` contract term. Over time, a subscription can be associated with several non-`active` contract terms. The `active` contract term for a subscription is available as an [object](subscriptions#subscription_contract_term) within the subscription.

        To enable and configure contract terms, follow these steps in the Chargebee UI:

        1. Click **Settings** on the left navigation.
        2. Click **Configure Chargebee**.
        3. Under **Billing** , click **Contract Terms**.
        4. Enable and configure the feature as needed.

        Once contract terms have been configured, the following actions can be performed using the API:

        * **Define a contract term** for a subscription and **set renewal options** for the contract term. The following endpoints support this:
          * [Create a subscription](subscriptions#create_subscription_for_items)
          * [Update a subscription](subscriptions#update_subscription_for_items)
          * [Reactivate a subscription](subscriptions#reactivate_a_subscription)
        * **Retrieving** a historical record of all contract terms for a subscription can be done via the following endpoint:
          * [List contract terms for a subscription](subscriptions#list_contract_terms_for_a_subscription)
        * **Canceling a contract term** can be done via the following endpoints:
          * [Update a subscription](subscriptions#update_subscription_for_items)
          * [Cancel a subscription](subscriptions#cancel_subscription_for_items)

        <!-- -->

        #### Including a termination fee

        * When a contract is canceled mid-term, you can set a termination fee to be levied. Here's how:
        1. [Create](item_prices#create_an_item_price) an item price for an item of [type](items#item_type) `charge` with [price](item_prices#create_an_item_price_price) set to the termination fee.
        2. Do one of the following:
           * [Attach the charge-item to a plan](attached_items#create_an_attached_item), setting the `charge_on_event` parameter to `contract_termination`. OR
           * [Include the charge-item price on a subscription](subscriptions#create_subscription_for_items), setting the `subscription_items[charge_on_event][i]` parameter to `contract_termination`.
        * Once the above steps are done, the termination fee will be charged automatically if you [terminate the contract in the middle of its term](subscriptions#cancel_subscription_for_items_contract_term_cancel_option).

                  attribute. The `customer` attribute is specified using

                  can be redeemed only once for every unique value of

                  times for any particular `customer` record.

        Overview {#overview}
        --------------------

        Coupons are deductions applied to invoices or invoice line items. They're designed to be consumed by your customers directly. A coupon deduction can either be for a fixed amount or for a percentage of the amount of the invoice or line item.  
        **Note:**

        If you wish to provide discounts to your customers via API or the Chargebee app, see [Discounts API](/docs/api/discounts)

        Order of application of coupons and discounts {#precedence}
        -----------------------------------------------------------

        When both <coupons> and <discounts> are applied simultaneously to a [subscription](subscriptions) or [one-time invoice](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges), they're applied in the following order:  
        {#c8112732-82d8-406d-adad-a832fcb071a5}

        |---|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

        | 1 | Line-level, fixed amount coupons      | `coupon` with apply_on{#a9499b7a-8534-4a0c-b4d4-e66ab1dc88d9} = `each_specified_item` and `discount_type` = `flat` |
        | 2 | Line-level, fixed amount discounts    | `discount` with `apply_on` = `specific_item_price` and `type` = `fixed_amount`                                     |
        | 3 | Line-level, percentage coupons        | `coupon` with `apply_on` = `each_specified_item` and `discount_type` = `percentage`                                |

        | 5 | Invoice-level, fixed amount coupons   | `coupon` with `apply_on` = `invoice_amount` and `discount_type` = `flat`                                           |

        For example, consider the following scenario:

        A subscription is created with:

        * a plan price of $200 per month
        * an addon price of $20 per month
        * a flat $5 invoice discount
        * a 1% off coupon on the addon
        * a flat $2 coupon on the invoice

        The above coupons and discount are applied in the following order:  

        |---|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
        |   | **Discount or coupon applied**              | **Subtotal at each step**                     |
        | 1 | Initial subtotal (plan price + addon price) | $200 + $20 = $220                             |
        | 2 | 1% off coupon on the addon                  | $200 + $(20 - 0.02) = $200 + $19.98 = $219.98 |
        | 3 | Flat $2 coupon on the invoice               | $219.98 - $2 = $217.98                        |
        | 4 | Flat $5 invoice discount                    | $217.98 - $5 = **$212.98**                    |

For `needs_attention` status Chargebee automatically reconcile the transaction for few gateways, for rest of the gateways you have to use the [Reconcile transaction API](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2#reconcile_transaction). You can use this API to update the `id_at_gateway` (Gateway Transaction ID) and `status` for a [`needs_attention`](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2#transaction_status) transaction to be reconciled at par with the gateway.

                  \* voided - The transaction got voided or authorization expired at gateway. \* late_failure - Indicates that a successful payment transaction has failed now due to a late failure notification from the payment gateway, typically caused by issues like insufficient funds or a closed bank account. \* timeout - Transaction failed because of Gateway not accepting the connection. \* success - The transaction is successful. \* failure - Transaction failed. Refer the 'error_code' and 'error_text' fields to know the reason for failure \* in_progress - Transaction is being processed by the gateway. This typically happens for [direct debit transactions](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/direct-debit-payments.html) or, in case of cards, refund transactions. Such transactions can take 2-7 days to complete, depending on the gateway and payment method.

        A [Credit Note](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/credit-notes.html) is a
        document that specifies the money owed by a business to its customer.
        The seller usually issues a Credit Note for the same or lower amount
        than the invoice, and then repays the money to the customer or set it
        off against other 'due' invoices.


        ### Credit Note Types {#credit_note_types}


        Credit notes in Chargebee are categorized into three types:


        1. `adjustment`: Adjustment credit notes are used to adjust the amount
        of an existing invoice in the `payment_due` or `not_paid`
        [status](invoices?lang=curl#invoice_status). Use this type of credit
        note to reduce the invoice amount, typically as a discount to the
        customer.  

        Adjustment credit notes are automatically created in the following
        cases:


        * When an invoice is written off.

        * When a subscription is modified with proration enabled, and the
        invoice for the current term is in the `payment_due` or `not_paid`
        [status](invoices?lang=curl#invoice_status).


        2. `refundable`: Refundable credit notes allow you to return a certain
        amount to the customer. These credits can be:


        * Retained for automatic application on future invoices.

        * Applied to existing unpaid invoices.

        * Refunded to the customer.


        Refundable credit notes are automatically created in the following
        cases:


        * When an invoice is refunded.

        * When a subscription is changed or canceled with proration enabled, the
        invoice for the current term is in the `paid`
        [status](invoices?lang=curl#invoice_status). Refundable credits are
        applied to future invoices or can be refunded to the original payment
        method.


        3. `store`: Store credit notes are created for `paid` or
        `partially_paid` invoice [status](invoices?lang=curl#invoice_status)
        during subscription changes, such as upgrades, downgrades, or
        cancellations.


        Key characteristics of store credits:


        * No tax component is included at the time of creation.

        * A credit note document is generated, similar to refundable credits.

        * Store credits are applied before tax calculations on future invoices.


        **Note:** If you have enabled *consolidated invoicing* , to know the
        subscriptions attached with a credit note you have to refer
        [line_item's](credit_notes#credit_note_line_items) *subscription_id* .
        The credit note's *subscription_id* should **not** be used (which will
        be *null* if the credit note has lines from multiple subscriptions).

        Chargebee's Multi-currency feature allows you to create Plans in multiple currencies, enabling your customers to conveniently pay in their preferred local currency. Please review this [documentation](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/multi-currency-pricing.html) to understand the multi-currency feature in Chargebee.  

        This currency resource contains exchange rate configurations associated with a specific currency. The multi-currency feature must be [enabled](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/multi-currency-pricing.html#1-adding-and-managing-currencies), and all prerequisites must be addressed to successfully add a new currency via the API.  
        To invoke a single currency-specific API like update, retrieve, and more, the currency ID has to be passed as a path parameter. You can use list API to fetch the IDs of each currency configured in your site to use with the currency-specific APIs below. Chargebee supports billing in over [100 currencies](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/supported-currencies.html).   
        On this page, you can find information about how currency units are expressed in the API, as well as some pointers to keep in mind when using multiple currencies.

        Currency values {#handling_currency_units}
        ------------------------------------------

        By default, the Chargebee API supports only whole numbers for currency values. To allow for fractional (decimal) values, you must enable the [multi-decimal pricing](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/multi-decimal-support.html) feature. Additionally, the units in which currencies are expressed in the API depend on whether the currency is zero-decimal and whether multi-decimal pricing is enabled.

        ### Whole number currency values {#md_disabled}

        By default, Chargebee supports currency values in whole numbers; fractions are not supported. In the API, currency values can be identified by checking their data types. For all whole number currency values in this API, the data type is indicated as "in cents" in this documentation.

        The specific unit used for the currency in the API depends on whether it is a zero-decimal currency:

        * **Zero-decimal currencies** : For currencies that do not have decimal subunits, such as the Japanese Yen (JPY), the amount must be provided in the major unit of the currency. The major unit of a currency is the unit represented by its [ISO 4217
          code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html). For example, to specify an amount of JPY 15, set the amount as `15`. {#md-disabled-zero}
        * **Other currencies** : For currencies that are not zero-decimal, Chargebee supports values up to two decimal places in the major unit of the currency. This value with two decimal places must be converted to an integer by multiplying it by 100. For example, $1.53 should be provided as 1.53 x 100, which is `153`. {#md-disabled-non-zero}

        ### Fractional currency values {#md_enabled}

        When [multi-decimal pricing](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/multi-decimal-support.html#configuring-multi-decimal-support) is enabled in Chargebee, you can work with fractional currency values using dedicated API parameters and attributes of the `String` type. Usually, these attributes and parameters have the suffix `_in_decimal` in their names. The value is expressed in the major unit of the currency, which is the unit represented
        by its [ISO 4217
        code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html). For example, $1.6782 should be provided as `1.6782`. The maximum number of decimal places supported by the API can be [configured](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/multi-decimal-support.html#configuring-multi-decimal-support) in
        the admin console.

        **Note:** For **zero-decimal currencies**, such as the Japanese Yen (JPY), decimal places are not allowed.

        #### Rounding of invoice line item amounts {#rounding}

        While Chargebee supports multiple decimal places for currency values, at the [invoice line
        item](/docs/api/invoices#invoice_line_items_amount)-level, the `amount` attribute is always rounded off to two decimal places in the major unit of the currency. The major unit of a currency is the unit represented by its [ISO 4217 code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html). The rounding logic used is [ROUND_HALF_EVEN](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html#ROUND_HALF_EVEN). For example, if the [quantity](/docs/api/invoices#invoice_line_items_quantity) is 0.0765 and [unit_amount](/docs/api/invoices#invoice_line_items_unit_amount) is $10.674, the line item [amount](/docs/api/invoices#invoice_line_items_amount) is (0.0765 x $10.674) = $0.816561 and is rounded off to $0.82.

        Multi-currency support {#multi_currency_support}
        ------------------------------------------------

        By default, Chargebee is able to process transactions in only one currency. However, you can enable the [multi-currency](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/multi-currency-pricing.html) feature to support more currencies. The first currency enabled in Chargebee also becomes the "base currency" by default. If you have multiple currencies enabled and want to change the base currency for your site, reach out to [Support](https://support.chargebee.com) for assistance.  
        **Warning**

        For some API endpoints, the `currency_code` parameter becomes *required* when the multi-currency feature is enabled. Before enabling the feature for your site, ensure that you update your code to provide the `currency_code` parameter when calling the endpoints listed in the next section.

        ### List of affected endpoints {#multi_currency_support}

        The following endpoints require the `currency_code` parameter to be passed when the multi-currency feature has been enabled.

            When the `customer` resource is [transferred](business_entities?prod_cat_ver=2#transfer_resources_to_another_business_entity) to a different [business_entity](business_entities?prod_cat_ver=2), Chargebee assigns a new random identifier to the `id` attribute. The original identifier is preserved for the transferred copy of the `customer` resource. (See also: [Mechanics of business entity transfer](business_entities?prod_cat_ver=2#mechanics).)

        **Breaking Change**:


        * **[Sites](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/sites-intro.html) created
        before March 1, 2014** : [updating the
        card](cards?prod_cat_ver=2#update_card_for_a_customer) deletes the
        customer's `billing_address` and `vat_number` and replaces them with
        values from the request.

        * **Sites created on or after March 1, 2014** : updating the card
        doesn't change the `billing_address` and `vat_number`.

        Differential pricing helps implement a pricing strategy for addons and charges based on the plans they're purchased with. A differential price a specific price for an addon- or charge-[item price](./item_prices?prod_cat_ver=2) when purchased along with a particular plan.

        Differential pricing for addons
        -------------------------------

        Consider an addon called 24x7 Customer Support provided with a cloud storage service. You can configure differential prices for each of the addon-item prices based on the plan they are purchased with, as follows:

        |---|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
        |   | **Addon item price**                                | **Price when applied to *Standard*** **Plan** | **Price when applied to** ***Enterprise*** **Plan** |
        | 1 | 24x7 Customer Support, USD, Monthly, Flat fee, $100 | $90                                           | $150                                                |
        | 2 | 24x7 Customer Support, USD, Yearly, Flat fee, $1000 | $900                                          | $1500                                               |

        Differential pricing for charges
        --------------------------------

        Consider a charge, called Setup fee, for installing and configuring a cloud-based project management platform. There are two modes in which you can set up differential pricing for a charge:

        #### Mode A: One charge differential price per plan-item

        This mode is used to specify one differential price for the charge-item price per [plan-item](./items?prod_cat_ver=2) it is applied to.

        |-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
        | **Charge-item price**         | **Price when applied to** ***Standard*** **plan** | **Price when applied to** ***Enterprise*** **plan** |
        | Setup fee, USD, Flat fee $500 | $400                                              | $700                                                |

        #### Mode B: Multiple charge differential prices per plan item

        This mode is used to specify multiple differential prices for the charge per plan-item, based on the plan period.

        |-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | **Charge-item price**         | **Price when applied to** ***Standard*** **plan, 6 months** | **Price when applied to** ***Standard*** **plan, yearly** |
        | Setup fee, USD, Flat fee $500 | $400                                                        | $300                                                      |

        A `discount`, just like [coupons](/docs/api/coupons), represents a deduction from the amounts in an `invoice`. While coupons are typically used by your customers, `discount`s can be directly applied to subscriptions by your sales team while negotiating new deals or upgrades. If the negotiations are on the price itself, the [price override](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/price-override.html#api) feature helps adjust the price further.

        Although a `discount` appears as a deduction on an invoice, it is applied to a `subscription` while creating or updating the `subscription`. Every `discount` in Chargebee is attached to only one `subscription`.  
        **Note:**

        * The sum of the line-item-level and invoice-level coupons together for a subscription, cannot exceed 10.
        * When discounts are enabled in Chargebee, the [multi-coupons feature](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/coupons.html#applying-multiple-coupons-to-a-subscription) is automatically activated.

        A `discount` can be added to a `subscription` by calling either [Create subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items) or [Update subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#update_subscription_for_items). Once added, the `discount` is applied to all subsequent invoices if `apply_on` is set to `invoice_amount`. When `apply_on` = `specific_item_price`, the discount is applied (as a `discount.line_item_discount`) in each invoice of the subscription that contains the specified item.

        ### Invoices

        A `discount` can be added to an `invoice` using [Create invoice for items and one-time charges](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges) using the `discounts` parameter.

        ### Quotes

        A `discount` can be added to a `quote` using the following operations:

        * [Create a quote for new subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_a_new_subscription_items)
        * [Create a quote for updating a subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_update_subscription_items)
        * [Create a quote for charge and charge item](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_charge_and_charge_items)
        * [Edit a quote for a new subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_create_subscription_quote_for_items)
        * [Edit a quote for updating a subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_update_subscription_quote_for_items)
        * [Edit a quote for charge items and charges](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_quote_for_charge_items_and_charges)

        ### Estimates

        A discount can be added to an estimate using the following endpoints:

        * [Estimate for creating a subscription.](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_creating_a_subscription)
        * [Estimate for creating a customer and subscription](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_creating_a_customer_and_subscription)
        * [Estimate for updating a subscription](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_updating_a_subscription)

        Removing a discount
        -------------------

        ### Subscriptions

        A `discount` can be removed by calling [Update subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#update_subscription_for_items) with the relevant `discounts[operation_type][]` set to `remove`. Also, discounts that have `duration_type` as `one_time` or `limited_period` are removed automatically upon expiry.

        ### Quotes

        A discount can be removed from a quote using the following operations:

        * [Edit a quote for a new subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_create_subscription_quote_for_items)
        * [Edit a quote for updating a subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_update_subscription_quote_for_items)

        ### Estimates

        A discount can be removed from an estimate using the following operation:

        * [Estimate for updating a subscription](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_updating_a_subscription)

        Listing discounts
        -----------------

        A discount is associated with exactly one subscription. You can fetch all the discounts currently attached to a subscription by calling the [List discounts for a subscription API](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#list_discounts_for_a_subscription) or by passing `include_discounts` as `true` while creating, importing, updating or retrieving a subscription.

        Order of application of coupons and discounts {#precedence}
        -----------------------------------------------------------

        When both <coupons> and <discounts> are applied simultaneously to a [subscription](subscriptions) or [one-time invoice](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges), they're applied in the following order:  
        {#c8112732-82d8-406d-adad-a832fcb071a5}

        For example, consider the following scenario:

        A subscription is created with:

        * a plan price of $200 per month
        * an addon price of $20 per month
        * a flat $5 invoice discount
        * a 1% off coupon on the addon
        * a flat $2 coupon on the invoice

        The above coupons and discount are applied in the following order:  

        |---|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
        |   | **Discount or coupon applied**              | **Subtotal at each step**                     |
        | 1 | Initial subtotal (plan price + addon price) | $200 + $20 = $220                             |
        | 2 | 1% off coupon on the addon                  | $200 + $(20 - 0.02) = $200 + $19.98 = $219.98 |
        | 3 | Flat $2 coupon on the invoice               | $219.98 - $2 = $217.98                        |
        | 4 | Flat $5 invoice discount                    | $217.98 - $5 = **$212.98**                    |

        `subscriptions` inherit `entitlement`s from `item`s and/or `item price`s that are in them. Even so, there are many reasons why you may want to override the inherited entitlements on a subscription:

        * A customer wants access to a `feature` that the `item`s on their `subscription` are not entitled to.
        * A customer wants a higher `feature.level` without having to pay more.
        * A customer does not want to see or access a `feature` because it is irrelevant to them.
        * You offer customized `feature` bundles for each `subscription` instead of grouping `feature`s into a product catalog of `item`s.

        This API helps you implement each of the above use cases, offering a method to directly set the `value` for any `subscription_entitlement`.  
        **`entitlement_override` expiry**

        If [expires_at](/docs/api/entitlement_overrides#entitlement_override_expires_at) has been set, then the `entitlement_override` object is no longer returned after `expires_at` has passed. The expiration of an `entitlement_override` does not trigger any event immediately. However, after expiry, the `entitlement_override `record gets deleted within 12 hours. This deletion triggers the `entitlement_overrides_auto_removed `event which can be considered as a notification, albeit delayed, for one or more `entitlement_overrides `having expired.

                    It refers to the total amount of revenue that is expected to
                    be generated from a specific contract term, calculated as
                    the sum of all invoices raised during the term, regardless
                    of payment status. It is based on past performance and the
                    specified currency in the contract. If the subscription was
                    imported, the value for `total_amount_raised_before_tax` is
                    included in the calculation of the total contract value
                    before tax. It's important to note that this value excludes
                    any applicable taxes.

        During the process of signing up customers to subscriptions, use the
        Estimates API to evaluate the details of the purchase before actually
        signing them up. The details returned by the API include the invoice
        amounts, next billing date and unbilled charges.


        For example, consider that you are creating a new subscription or update
        an existing one. Use the Estimates API before that to deduce the details
        such as the amount the customer would be charged, the state the
        subscription would be in after creation or updation, and so on.

        ### Introduction

        Whenever any important changes happen in your Chargebee site, they are recorded as events. An event contains data about affected resources and additional details such as when the change occurred. For example, when a subscription is cancelled due to non payment, an event `subscription_cancelled` is recorded.

        ### Webhooks {#webhooks_pcv2}

        If webhooks have been [configured](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/webhook_settings.html#configure-webhooks) in Chargebee, events trigger those webhooks. If multiple webhooks have been configured, for every event, each webhook is called one after another. If a webhook call for an event fails or times out, it is retried based on a [fixed schedule](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/webhook_settings.html#automatic-retries). The webhook call is an HTTP POST with content type `application/json`.

        (like in-process, completed...) . If the status is completed, it will

            `number of users` can have entitlement levels of say, `5`, `20`,
            `50`, and `100`. `levels[is_unlimited]` is used for specifying the

            set of whole numbers within a range. The range is defined by a
            minimum and a maximum value. For example, a feature such as `number
            of users` can have entitlement levels starting at `5` users and go
            up to `50000`. `levels[is_unlimited]` is used for specifying the

                  Provide a name that helps you clearly identify the entitlement
                  level. For example: a feature such as `Email Support` can have
                  entitlement levels named as `All weekdays`, `All days`, `40
                  hours per week` and so on. When not provided for

                  `levels[].value` and the pluralized version of `unit`. For

                  The value denoting the entitlement level granted.


                  * **When `type` is `quantity`:** this attribute denotes the
                  quantity of units of the feature for this entitlement level.
                  For example, a feature such as `number of users` can have
                  `levels[].value` as `5`, `20`, `50`, and `100`.
                  `levels[].is_unlimited` is used to set the entitlement level
                  to "unlimited".

                  * **When `type` is `range`:** there can be be only two
                  elements in the `levels[]` array; one corresponding to the
                  minimum value (`levels[0]`) and the other to the maximum value
                  (`levels[1]`) of the range of possible entitlement levels. For
                  example, a feature such as `number of users` may have
                  `levels[0].value` = `5` and `levels[1].value` = `50000`. When
                  the upper limit is "unlimited", then `levels[1].value` is not
                  set and `levels[1].is_unlimited` is `true`.

                  * **When `type` is `custom`:** this attribute denotes the
                  value of this custom entitlement level. For example, a feature
                  `Email Support` can have `levels[].value` as one of say,
                  `24×7` and `24×5`.

                  from lowest to highest.  


                  * When `type` is `quantity` or `custom`: The lowest
                  entitlement level has the value `0`, the next higher level has
                  the value `1`, followed by `2`, and so on.

                  * When `type` is `range`: This attribute is `0` for the
                  minimum value and `1` for the maximum value in the range.


                  When not defined, it is assumed as the index of the `levels[]`

        Subscriptions are created in Chargebee using items. Items represent the
        products or services that you offer to your customers. Items often
        differ in the number of product features that are available to them. The
        Features API helps you define the various features offered as part of
        your product line. It also defines the entitlements that items and
        subscriptions can have towards said features.  

        **Note**


        The maximum number of features a site can have is 400.


        Features of this API {#features}

        --------------------------------


        The Features API enables you to:


        * Define the set of features provided by your product.

        * Specify the entitlements that items have towards said features.

        * For a given subscription, modify the entitlements inherited from items
        in the subscription.

        * Offer additional feature entitlements to subscriptions than those
        inherited from items in the subscription.

        * Serve as a source of truth to your provisioning systems for
        subscription entitlements.

        * Use entitlement information to understand which features drive value
        and revenue.

        Gift represents a subscription of a customer(**recipient** ) to a 'gift
        plan' which has been gifted by another customer(**gifter**). It may also
        have addons and coupons. Gift will be created only on immediate
        successful payment collection from the gifter's payment method.


        Gift is initially created in '**scheduled** ' state. The gift can be
        scheduled to be notified on a particular date to the recipient by
        passing 'scheduled_at'. If not, the recipient is notified immediately.
        Gift will be moved to '**unclaimed** ' state on the date of
        notification. If you pass auto_claim as true, gift status will be moved
        to '**claimed**' immediately, otherwise, the gift will remain
        'unclaimed' till the recipient claims the gift.


        If the gift is not claimed before the claim_expiry_date, it will be
        moved to the '**expired**' state.


        #### GIFT SUBSCRIPTION


        Gift subscriptions will be created in '**future** ' state. Once the gift
        is claimed, the subscription will be moved to '**non-renewing**' state.


        #### INVOICE


        Gift subscriptions will be invoiced immediately. The invoice created has
        **is_gifted** as 'true' and **term_finalized** as 'false'. This is
        because initially the invoice term_start and term_end are set as the
        subscription's start_date till the end of the plan period. Once the gift
        is claimed, the invoice's term_finalized will be marked as 'true'. The
        term_start will be changed to the actual invoice's term, which is the
        gift-claim date and the term_end will be changed till plan's period.

            This attribute allows you to store custom information with the `hosted_page` object. You can use it to associate specific data with a hosted page session.

            For example, you can store the ID of the marketing campaign that initiated the user session. After a successful checkout, when the customer is redirected, you can retrieve the hosted page ID from the [redirect URL](hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_checkout_for_a_new_subscription_redirect_url)'s query parameters. Using this ID, you can fetch the hosted page and perform actions related to the success of the marketing campaign.

        Hosted pages are the easiest way to integrate Chargebee with your website. For card payment methods, they help meet most of your PCI DSS compliance requirements. Chargebee offers hosted pages where your customers can perform the following actions:

        * [Checkout a new subscription](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_checkout_for_a_new_subscription)
        * [Checkout changes to an existing subscription](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_checkout_to_update_a_subscription)
        * [Update a payment method](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#update_payment_method)
        * [Make payments for all due invoices](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#collect_now)
        * [Extending a subscription](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#extend_subscription)

        When you create a hosted page, it is available at a secure and unique URL. This URL can then be provided to your customer on your website or by other means such as email. On successful completion of the hosted page workflow by the customer, they are redirected to the `redirect_url` with the hosted page `id` and `state` passed as query string parameters. As soon as the redirection happens, [retrieve the hosted page](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#retrieve_a_hosted_page) to get details of the customer, subscription, invoice etc.

        **Important:**

        These APIs operate asynchronously. When you receive a successful response code from an API call, it indicates only the successful submission of your request, not the completion of the operation.

        Using In-app Subscriptions, you can track subscriptions you sell and service via in-app purchase channels such as
        Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. Call [this
        API](/docs/api/in_app_subscriptions#process_purchase_command) to notify Chargebee of new subscription purchases. Chargebee responds by creating corresponding
        subscriptions. You can make the API call directly from the client-side application or from your server. In the case of the Apple App Store and Google Play Store integration, you can also configure Chargebee to receive server notifications from [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreservernotifications) and [Google](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/rtdn-reference#sub) to keep subscriptions up-to-date.  
        **Note:**



        After creating a subscription in Chargebee using the [process purchase command](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/in_app_subscriptions#process_purchase_command)API, Chargebee manages it in real-time using notification events from [Apple](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/in_app_purchase_events#app_store_notifications) or [Google](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/in_app_purchase_events#play_store_notifications). To enable these notifications, generate a notification URL using these links - [Apple](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/mobile-app-store-product-iap.html#connection-keys_notification-url) and [Google](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/mobile-playstore-notifications.html) and configure it in their respective stores.  
        **In-app subscriptions are read-only**

        The subscriptions created via the [Process
        Purchase Command API](/docs/api/in_app_subscriptions#process_purchase_command) are managed by Apple or Google in response to actions taken by your subscribers via
        their respective accounts. Chargebee only keeps track of these subscriptions: creating and modifying them in
        response to events happening against the original subscriptions. Consequently, these subscriptions cannot be
        modified by you via the Chargebee admin console or the [Subscriptions API](/docs/api/subscriptions).

Refer the 'error_code' and 'error_text' fields to know the reason for failure \* in_progress - Transaction is being processed by the gateway. This typically happens for [direct debit transactions](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/direct-debit-payments.html) or, in case of cards, refund transactions. Such transactions can take 2-7 days to complete, depending on the gateway and payment method. \* success - The transaction is successful. \* voided - The transaction got voided or authorization expired at gateway. \* needs_attention - When connection with the Gateway gets terminated abruptly. For `needs_attention` status Chargebee automatically reconcile the transaction for few gateways, for rest of the gateways you have to use the [Reconcile transaction API](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2#reconcile_transaction). You can use this API to update the `id_at_gateway` (Gateway Transaction ID) and `status` for a [`needs_attention`](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2#transaction_status) transaction to be reconciled at par with the gateway.

For `needs_attention` status Chargebee automatically reconcile the transaction for few gateways, for rest of the gateways you have to use the [Reconcile transaction API](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2#reconcile_transaction). You can use this API to update the `id_at_gateway` (Gateway Transaction ID) and `status` for a [`needs_attention`](transactions?prod_cat_ver=2#transaction_status) transaction to be reconciled at par with the gateway.  
                  [Learn more](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/payments/2.0/needs-attention-transactions.html) about `needs_attention` transaction status
                  \* failure - Transaction failed. Refer the 'error_code' and 'error_text' fields to know the reason for failure \* voided - The transaction got voided or authorization expired at gateway. \* in_progress - Transaction is being processed by the gateway. This typically happens for [direct debit transactions](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/direct-debit-payments.html) or, in case of cards, refund transactions. Such transactions can take 2-7 days to complete, depending on the gateway and payment method. \* timeout - Transaction failed because of Gateway not accepting the connection. \* late_failure - Indicates that a successful payment transaction has failed now due to a late failure notification from the payment gateway, typically caused by issues like insufficient funds or a closed bank account.

        An invoice is a commercial document representing a sale of products/services offered by you to a customer. It enumerates all the charges, adjustments, payments, discounts and taxes associated with the sale.

        An invoice is said to be a recurring one when it is has at least one charge for [a plan or an addon item price](./items?prod_cat_ver=2). It is a non-recurring one when it has charges for only charge-item prices or [one-time charges](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/charges.html).

        The item prices for any given billing term of a subscription are billed via an invoice at the beginning of the term (unless the charges are left unbilled). However, item prices that belong to `metered` items are billed at the end of the term via a `pending` invoice that can [close automatically](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/metered_billing.html#configuring-metered-billing) or via [an API call](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#close_a_pending_invoice). Moreover, when there are no `metered` items in the subscription, the invoices can still be generated as `pending` while [creating](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items) or [updating](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#update_subscription_for_items) a subscription.

        #### Auto-collection

        If [auto-collection](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/customers.html#auto-collection-status) is enabled, then immediately on invoice generation (or, in case of subscriptions that have `create_pending_invoices` as `true`, on [invoice closure](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#close_a_pending_invoice)), the [payment method](./customers?prod_cat_ver=2#customer_payment_method) on file is charged:

        * If the payment succeeds, the invoice is marked as `paid`.
        * On payment failure, the invoice is marked as `payment_due` and [dunning settings](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/dunning-v2.html) are taken into account for payment retries.
        * If no retry attempts are configured, or when retries are exhausted, the invoice is marked as `not_paid`.
        * the amount due is zero or negative, the invoice is immediately marked as `paid` and the balance, if any, is added to [excess payments](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/customers.html#excess-payments) for the customer.

        When offering subscriptions of products or services, each entity that is
        made available for sale is represented by an "item" object. Items
        therefore represent the various plans, addons or charges that you offer
        as part of your product catalog. Non-`metered` items are charged upfront
        in Chargebee, while `metered` items are charged at the end of the
        billing cycle, based on usage.


        ### Types of Items


        There are three types of items and they're listed and explained here.
        Examples for each type are provided in the table that follows.


        #### Plan-items or Plans


        Plan-items are items that have a recurring charge and are an essential
        component of any [subscription](./subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2).
        Typically, plans represent a principal or key product or service in your
        catalog. They are charged at recurring intervals and often have other
        products or services offered along with them as addons and charges.


        #### Addon-items or Addons {#addon-items}


        Addon-items are items that are sold along with a plan and are charged
        for at recurring intervals.


        #### Charge-items or Charges


        Charge-items are items that are sold along with a plan but charged once
        (or each time) a specified event occurs. A charge can also be [applied
        to a
        customer](./invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_a_charge-item)
        without attaching to a subscription.


        #### Examples


        To help understand each type of item better, listed below are some
        examples of items from different business domains:


        ##### Non-Metered (SaaS)


        * **Item Family:** A project management solution.

        * **Plans:**
          * A "basic" plan offering a small set of features.
          * A "business" plan offering a larger set of features.
        * **Addons:**
          * An analytics plugin that is available only with the "business" plan.
          * A reporting plugin, available with both the above plans.
        * **Charges:**
          * Implementation charges.
          * Trial charges.



        ##### Non-Metered (E-commerce)


        * **Item Family:** A printed news magazine.

        * **Plans:**
          * Periodic issues of the magazine.
          * Periodic issues of the magazine, with digital content.
        * **Addons:**
          * Supplementary online content.
          * Access to a year's worth of back issues.
          * Searchable access to all back issues.
        * **Charges:**
          * Special edition books that are published every so often.



        ##### Metered


        * **Item Family:** SMS delivery services.

        * **Plans:**
          * A basic plan of up to 100K messages @ $0.03 per message.
          * A volume plan of 2M messages @ $0.01 per message.
        * **Addons:**
          * An addon of 50K MMS messages @ $0.1 per message.
          * Instant messaging.
        * **Charges:**
          * Automated Metered Billing is not applicable for charges.

        This API remains operational, but we recommend transitioning to its
        successor: [Entitlements API](entitlements).


        [Items](/docs/api/items) represent the products or services that you
        offer to your customers. Items often differ from each other in the
        product [features](/docs/api/features) that are available in them. An
        item entitlement object represents the entitlement an item has towards a
        feature. An item can have multiple such entitlements, each corresponding
        to a unique feature it is entitled to.


        Item entitlements can be created while [creating a
        feature](/docs/api/features#create_a_feature). All subscriptions
        containing an item also
        [inherit](docs/api/subscription_entitlements#inheritance) its
        entitlements.

        If you're a company that sells multiple product lines then each product
        line or service is an item family in the Chargebee API. For example, if
        you are a SaaS company that offers separate products for project
        management, content collaboration, and customer support. Each of those
        can be an item family under which the various plans, addons and charges
        can be the [items](items?prod_cat_ver=2).

        Item families compartmentalize items such that only items belonging to
        the same family can be part of any given subscription.

                  Pricing type for the tier. \* flat_fee - Indicates that the

                  regardless of the number of units consumed. For the
                  **stairstep** pricing model, `pricing_type` will be set to

                  the maximum number of units within that tier. \* per_unit -
                  Indicates that the tier pricing is based on individual units.
                  Customers are charged a fixed price per unit. For example, if
                  the price per unit is $2 and the customer consumes 150 units,
                  they will be charged $300 (150 × $2). \* package - Indicates
                  that the tier pricing is based on a package of units.
                  Customers are charged for each block or package of units. For
                  example, if the package size is 100 units and the cost per
                  block is $20 consuming 400 units will result in a charge of
                  $80 (4 × $20).

        An item price is a price point for an item. It defines the currency, pricing model, price, billing period and other attributes for an [item](./items?prod_cat_ver=2). For example, consider a cloud storage service as an item. Then each of the following defines an item price:

        * The cloud storage sold at USD 10 per month.
        * The same service sold at AUD 100 per year.
        * The service sold at a monthly rate determined by the following [stairstep](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/plans.html#pricing-models) pricing model:
          * 1--10 users for EUR 10
          * 11--25 users for EUR 20
          * 26--50 users for EUR 45
          * 51 and above for EUR 100

        The **billing period** of an item price (only applies to plan-item prices and addon-item prices), is the `period` of the item price in `period_unit`s. An item can have only one item price for a given currency and billing period.

        Types of item prices {#types}
        -----------------------------

        The type of an item price corresponds to the [type of the item](./items?prod_cat_ver=2) that the item price belongs to. In other words, item prices can be of the following types:

        * Plan-item prices
        * Addon-item prices
        * Charge-item prices

            * **When `type` is `range`:** there can be be only two elements in
            the `levels[]` array; one corresponding to the minimum value
            (`levels[0]`) and the other to the maximum value (`levels[1]`) of
            the range of possible entitlement levels. For example, a feature

            this custom entitlement level. For example, a feature `Email
            Support` can have `levels[].value` as one of say, `24×7` and `24×5`.

        the legacy version of the feature and its API. For help in migrating to
        the current system or using the legacy API for Chargebee Orders, please

        Orders are automatically generated for an invoice when it gets paid,
        based on the shipping preference chosen for the invoice's product and
        the shipping date configuration. They can be updated either via api or
        merchant web console (a.k.a admin console).

        Payment schedules for an invoice refer to a payment structure where the
        `amount_due` on an invoice is divided into smaller, more manageable
        parts, each of which is paid over a specified period. Payment schedule
        scheme is a configuration or set of rules for creating payment
        schedules. After creating a payment schedule scheme, you can use it to
        generate payment schedules for multiple invoices.

        The Payment Voucher resource represents a voucher that has been created
        for a customer to initiate voucher-based payment. This resource contains
        relevant details such as the voucher URL, the amount of the voucher, the
        status of the voucher, and more. Currently, the only supported
        voucher-based payment source is Boleto. Boleto is a payment method in
        Brazil that is regulated by the Central Bank of Brazil and is considered
        an official form of payment. This is also a popular voucher-based
        payment method in Brazil.  

        **Note:** This resource can be extended in the future to support other
        types of payment sources for vouchers.

        Customer Portal lets your customers to manage their account and billing
        themselves. Chargebee supports Single Sign-on (SSO) to access the
        customer portal. If you already have your own authentication for your
        website, it allows your authenticated customers to access their portal
        without having to login again.


        **Note:** You can instead allow your customers to access the portal via
        login page provided by Chargebee. [Read
        more](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/inapp-self-serve-portal.html).


        Please follow the below steps for supporting portal access via SSO:


        1. To enable the "Allow access to customer portal via API", click
        **Settings** \> **Configure Chargebee** \> **Customer Facing
        Essentials** \> **Checkout and Self Serve Portal** \> **Portal**.

        2. Provide a link in your website/application which your authenticated
        customers can use to access the portal (For example,
        {your_website_url}/portal_link).

        3. Handle the link request in your server code and create a portal
        session for the customer by calling Chargebee's "Create a portal
        session" API

        4. Forward the user to the access URL present in the "Portal Session"
        resource returned by the above API call.

        **Deprecated**

        The `purchase` resource and its associated operations on this page are deprecated. Avoid using them in your integrations. The ability to purchase multiple plans in a single subscription will be supported through the [Subscriptions API](subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2) in the future.

        The `purchase` resource represents a collection of [item prices](item_prices) bought together. A purchase can contain one or more of the following:

        * subscriptions (a [subscription](subscriptions) resource consists of item prices such that at least one of the item prices belongs to an [item](items) of `type` `plan`.)
        * group of one-time charges (aka [charge item prices](item_prices#types))

        **Prerequisite**

        Purchases must be enabled explicitly for the site. If not already enabled, contact eap@chargebee.com. Purchases require the following features to work so they're automatically enabled along with them:

        * [Consolidated Invoicing](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/consolidated-invoicing.html)
        * [Manual discounts](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/subscription-manual-discounts.html)
        * [Multiple coupon support](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/coupons.html#applying-multiple-coupons-to-a-subscription)
        * [Multi-decimal pricing and quantities](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/multi-decimal-support.html)  
        **Note**

        Once created, Chargebee never modifies a `purchase` resource; it cannot be modified via API either.

            Ireland** . The first two characters of the VAT number in such a case is `XI` by default. However, if the VAT number was registered in UK, the value should be `GB`. Set `vat_number_prefix` to `GB` for such cases.

        The line items of a quote are grouped by charge events and are available
        as a separate [resource](/docs/api/quote_line_groups). This resource can
        be retrieved using the [List quote line
        groups](/docs/api/quotes#list_quote_line_groups) endpoint. Note that the
        first quote line group is available within the quote resource itself and
        parsing the quote line groups object is not required.

        The line items of a quote are grouped by charge event. Each of these
        groups is called a quote line group. A quote would have at least one
        quote line group. Let's look at an example.  


        Consider the following:


        * A monthly plan A for $500 per month.

        * A non-recurring addon B for $50.


        Now consider a quote that is created for 3 billing cycles of the plan
        with the addon applied immediately. This quote would be associated with
        a list of quote line groups: one for each charge event as shown below:


        #### Quote Line group 1


        **Plan A:** $500   

        **Addon B:** $50   

        **Total:** $550   


        #### Quote Line group 2


        **Plan A:** $500   

        **Total:** $500   


        #### Quote Line group 3


        **Plan A:** $500

        **Important**


        * Record purchase operations are **asynchronous**, as they involve
        validating the purchase with the respective source, like Apple.

        * Currently, this resource is only applicable for Apple App Store.


        The recorded purchase resource represents a background job of syncing
        in-app purchases made through external storefronts like Apple with
        Chargebee. The

        [status](recorded_purchases?prod_cat_ver=2#recorded_purchase_status)

        (`in_process`, `completed`, and `failed`) attribute represents the
        current status of the background job.


        ### Record Apple In-App Purchase and Retrieve Associated
        Omni-Subscription and Transaction from Chargebee


        You can record in-app subscription purchases made on the Apple App Store
        in Chargebee using the

        `transaction[id]` received after a successful purchase.


        To record the purchase and retrieve subscription details, follow these
        steps:


        1. Use the [Record a Purchase
        API](recorded_purchases?prod_cat_ver=2#record_a_purchase) with the
           [app_id](recorded_purchasesl?prod_cat_ver=2#record_a_purchase_app_id),
           [customer[id]](recorded_purchasesl?prod_cat_ver=2#record_a_purchase_customer_id),
           and
           [transaction[id]](recorded_purchases?prod_cat_ver=2#record_a_purchase_apple_app_store_transaction_id).

        2. The API response will include a `recorded_purchase` object containing
        the
           [status](recorded_purchases?prod_cat_ver=2#recorded_purchase_status) of the purchase
           recording job.

        3. Once the purchase is successfully recorded, the
           [status](recorded_purchases?prod_cat_ver=2#recorded_purchase_status) attribute of
           the `recorded_purchase` object updates from `in_process` to `completed`. At
           this point, Chargebee creates an `omnichannel_subscription` resource and triggers an
           `omnichannel_subscription_created` webhook event, which contains the
           `omnichannel_subscription` and `omnichannel_transaction` objects.

        4. In addition to using Webhooks (push-based), you can retrieve details
        for a recorded purchase by using the [recorded purchase resource's
        ID](recorded_purchases#recorded_purchase_id), which is returned when you
        record the purchase.

        A Chargebee subscription connects a customer record to products/services. It describes what the customer has signed up for and how often they're charged for it. The essential components of a subscription are:

        * A [plan-item price](./item_prices?prod_cat_ver=2).
        * Any addon- and charge-item prices applied to the subscription.
        * Any [coupons](./coupons?prod_cat_ver=2) applied.
        * Any [discounts](./discounts?prod_cat_ver=2) applied.

        The charges in a subscription are billed via invoices.

        **Note:** The maximum number of subscriptions for any given [customer](customers) ([active](subscriptions#subscription_status) or not) is 900.  

        Subscription billing frequencies {#subscription-billing-frequencies}
        --------------------------------------------------------------------

        Chargebee offers two billing frequency options for subscriptions:

        * **Plan-based billing** (`default`): Subscriptions are billed based on the billing period defined for the item price of the `item_type` `plan`. [Learn more](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/subscriptions.html#subscription-billing-frequency_plan-based-billing).

        * **Multi-frequency billing** : Subscriptions are billed according to the billing period of each recurring item price within the subscription. [Learn more](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/subscriptions.html#subscription-billing-frequency_multi-frequency-billing).

          **Important**

          [Limitations](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/subscriptions.html#mfa-limitations) of Multi-frequency billing.  
          **Private Beta**

          Multi-frequency billing is in private beta. Please reach out to the Chargebee [support](https://support.chargebee.com/support/home) to enable this feature.

        The selection of the billing frequency preference is configured at the site level.  

        Item price compatibility in a subscription {#item-price-compatibility}
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------

        When creating or updating a subscription, one of the item prices specified under subscription_items must be a plan-item price. The remaining must be compatible addon- or charge-item prices. An item price is compatible with a plan-item price if their currencies are the same. Additionally, an addon-item price is compatible with a plan-item price only if their billing frequencies meet the following conditions:

        | `period_unit` for plan-item price | Compatible `period_unit` for addon-item price |                                                                                                                                                                                                   Compatible period for addon-item price                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

        Overview
        --------

        The `subscription_entitlement` object represents the entitlement a [subscription](subscriptions) holds for a [feature](features). A subscription can have several `subscription_entitlements`, each tied to a specific feature.

        How subscription entitlements are determined {#calculation}
        -----------------------------------------------------------

        When an [entitlement_override](entitlement_overrides) is set for a subscription related to a feature, the value of the `subscription_entitlement` takes on the [value](entitlement_overridesl#entitlement_override_value) of the `entitlement_override`.

        If there isn't an `entitlement_override`, the value of the `subscription_entitlement` is based on the [entitlement](entitlements)s linked to the [item_price](item_prices)s within the [subscription_items](subscriptions#subscription_subscription_items). If an `item_price` lacks an entitlement record for a particular feature, we consider the entitlement (when available) of its parent [item](items).

        The method used to derive the `subscription_entitlement` from `entitlement`s follows specific rules determined by the feature [type](features#feature_type). We outline and provide examples of these rules in the sections below:  

        ### Switch feature {#switch}

        #### Summary {#switch0}

        Consider a `feature` of type `switch`. Consider also a `subscription`, some of whose `subscription_item`s correspond to `item_price`s (or `item`s) that have `entitlement`s to the feature. Looking at these entitlements, we first determine the entitlement value held by each `subscription_item` for this feature.

        If the entitlement value for the feature held by **any** of the `subscription_item`s is `true`, then the `subscription_entitlement` `value` is also set to `true`. Otherwise, the `subscription_entitlement` `value` is also set to `false`.

        #### Example

        ##### 1. Feature record

        Consider the following [feature](features) record:

        |        `id`        |  `type`  |                    `description`                    |
        |--------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
        | `xero-integration` | `switch` | `An integration with the Xero accounting software.` |
        [Table 1: `feature` records.]

        ##### 2. Entitlement records

        Consider the following [entitlement](entitlements) records for the `xero-integration` feature:

        |      `entity_id`      | `entity_type` | `value` |
        |-----------------------|---------------|---------|
        | `starter`             | `plan`        | `true`  |
        | `starter-monthly-usd` | `plan_price`  | `false` |
        | `plus`                | `addon`       | `true`  |
        [Table 2: `entitlement` records for the `xero-integration` feature.]

        ##### 3. Subscription-items records

        Consider that a [subscription](subscriptions) with `id` `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` has the following `subscription.subscription_items[]` records:

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    | `quantity` |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
        | `0`                          | `starter-monthly-usd` | `1`        |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `1`        |
        | `2`                          | `installation-usd`    | `2`        |
        [Table 3: `subscription.subscription_items[]` records.]

        ##### 4. Subscription-item entitlements

        Chargebee Billing now determines the entitlement held by each `subscription_items[]` based on the entitlements defined in Table 2. This is shown in Table 4. For clarity, we've omitted the `quantity` column because it doesn't affect features with the `switch` `type`.

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    |                         Entitlement value (determined from Table 2)                          |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `0`                          | `starter-monthly-usd` | `false` (Matches the value of the plan price.)                                               |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `true` (Inherited from the addon `plus`, as no entitlement is defined for this addon price.) |
        | `2`                          | `installation-usd`    | None (No entitlement defined for the charge item.)                                           |
        [Table 4: Entitlement values for `subscription.subscription_items[]`.]

        ##### 5. Determining final subscription entitlements

        ###### Case 1: Absence of a subscription-level override

        In this scenario, the **final entitlement** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `xero-integration` feature is set to `true` because at least one subscription-item entitlement `value` is `true`.

        ###### Case 2: With subscription-level override

        Suppose there's an [entitlement_override](entitlement_overrides) added to the subscription for the feature, as shown below:

        |     `entity_id`     | `entity_type`  |    `feature_id`    | `value` |
        |---------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------|
        | `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` | `subscription` | `xero-integration` | `false` |
        [Table 5: `entitlement_override` record for the subscription and feature.]

        Given this override, the subscription's final entitlement value (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `xero-integration` feature is set to `false`.  

        ### Quantity feature {#quantity}

        #### Summary {#quantity0}

        Consider a `feature` of type `quantity`. Consider also a `subscription`, some of whose `subscription_items` correspond to `item_price`s (or `item`s) that have `entitlement`s to the feature. Looking at these entitlements, we first determine the entitlement value held by each `subscription_item` for this feature.

        If the entitlement value for the feature held by any of the `subscription_items` is `unlimited`, then the `subscription_entitlement` `value` is also `unlimited`. Otherwise, the `subscription_entitlement` `value` is the sum of all the entitlement values of the `subscription_items`.

        #### Example

        ##### 1. Feature record

        Consider the following `feature` record:

        |      `id`       |   `type`   |              `description`              |
        |-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|
        | `user_licenses` | `quantity` | `The number of user licenses provided.` |
        [Table 6: `feature` records.]

        Suppose that the feature has `feature.levels[]` records as follows:

        | `levels[].level` | `levels[].value` | `levels[].is_unlimited` |
        |------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
        | `0`              | `5`              | `false`                 |
        | `1`              | `10`             | `false`                 |
        | `2`              | `20`             | `false`                 |
        | `3`              | Not set.         | `true`                  |
        [Table 7: `feature.levels[]` records.]

        ##### 2. Entitlement records

        Consider the following `entitlement` records for the `user_licenses` feature:

        |      `entity_id`      | `entity_type` |   `value`   |
        |-----------------------|---------------|-------------|
        | `starter`             | `plan`        | `10`        |
        | `starter-monthly-usd` | `plan_price`  | `unlimited` |
        | `plus`                | `addon`       | `5`         |
        | `one-time`            | `charge`      | `5`         |
        [Table 8: `entitlement` records for the `user_licenses` feature.]

        ##### 3. Subscription-items records

        Consider that a `subscription` with `id` `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` has the following `subscription.subscription_items[]` records:

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    | `quantity` |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
        | `0`                          | `starter-monthly-usd` | `5`        |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `10`       |
        | `2`                          | `one-time-usd`        | `1`        |
        [Table 9: `subscription.subscription_items[]` records.]

        ##### 4. Subscription-item entitlements

        Chargebee Billing now determines the entitlement held by each `subscription_items[]` based on the entitlements defined in Table 8. This is shown in Table 10.

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    | `quantity` |                        Entitlement value (determined from Table 8)                        | Entitlement value subtotal (Entitlement value x `quantity`) |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `0`                          | `starter-monthly-usd` | `5`        | `unlimited` (Matches the value of the plan price.)                                        | `unlimited` (unlimited x 5)                                 |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `10`       | `5` (Inherited from the addon `plus`, as no entitlement is defined for this addon price.) | `50` (5 x 10)                                               |
        | `2`                          | `one-time-usd`        | `1`        | `5` (Inherited from the charge `one-time`.)                                               | `5` (5 x 1)                                                 |
        [Table 10: Entitlement values for `subscription.subscription_items[]`.]

        ##### 5. Determining final subscription entitlements

        ###### Case 1: Absence of a subscription-level override

        In this scenario, the **final entitlement** **value** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `user-licenses` feature is the total entitlement value from the last column in Table 10. Which amounts to (unlimited + 50 + 5) = `unlimited`.

        ###### Case 2: With subscription-level override

        Suppose there's an `entitlement_override` added to the subscription for the feature, as shown below:

        |     `entity_id`     | `entity_type`  |  `feature_id`   | `value` |
        |---------------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
        | `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` | `subscription` | `user_licenses` | `20`    |
        [Table 11: `entitlement_override` record for the subscription and feature.]

        Given this override, the subscription's **final entitlement** **value** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `user-licenses` feature is set to `20`.  

        ### Range feature {#range}

        #### Summary {#range0}

        Consider a `feature` of type `range`. Consider also a `subscription`, some of whose `subscription_items` correspond to `item_price`s (or `item`s) that have `entitlement`s to the feature. Looking at these entitlements, we first determine the entitlement value held by each `subscription_item` for this feature.

        If the entitlement value for the feature held by any of the `subscription_items` is `unlimited`, then the `subscription_entitlement` `value` is also `unlimited`. Otherwise, one of two scenarios are possible:

        * If `feature.levels[1].is_unlimited` is `true`, the `subscription_entitlement` `value` equals the sum of all entitlement values of the `subscription_items`.

        * If `feature.levels[1].is_unlimited` is `false`, the `subscription_entitlement` `value` equals the sum of all entitlement values of the `subscription_items` without exceeding the maximum value of `feature.level[1].value`.

        #### Example

        ##### 1. Feature record

        Consider the following `feature` record:

        |       `id`       | `type`  |                      `description`                       |
        |------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
        | `api_rate_limit` | `range` | `The maximum number of API requests allowed per minute.` |
        [Table 12: `feature` records.]

        Suppose that the feature has `feature.levels[]` records as follows:

        | `levels[].level` | `levels[].value` | `levels[].is_unlimited` |
        |------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
        | `0`              | `100`            | `false`                 |
        | `1`              | `1000`           | `false`                 |
        [Table 13: `feature.levels[]` records.]

        ##### 2. Entitlement records

        Consider the following `entitlement` records for the `api_rate_limit` feature:

        |      `entity_id`      | `entity_type` | `value` |
        |-----------------------|---------------|---------|
        | `premium`             | `plan`        | `450`   |
        | `premium-monthly-usd` | `plan_price`  | `400`   |
        | `plus`                | `addon`       | `150`   |
        [Table 14: `entitlement` records for the `api_rate_limit` feature.]

        ##### 3. Subscription-items records

        Consider that a `subscription` with `id` `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` has the following `subscription.subscription_items[]` records:

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    | `quantity` |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
        | `0`                          | `premium-monthly-usd` | `2`        |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `2`        |
        [Table 15: `subscription.subscription_items[]` records.]

        ##### 4. Subscription-item entitlements

        Chargebee Billing now determines the entitlement held by each `subscription_items[]` based on the entitlements defined in Table 14. This is shown in Table 16.

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    | `quantity` |                        Entitlement value (determined from Table 14)                         | Entitlement value subtotal (Entitlement value x `quantity`) |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `0`                          | `premium-monthly-usd` | `2`        | `400` (Matches the value of the plan price.)                                                | `800` (400 x 2)                                             |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `2`        | `150` (Inherited from the addon `plus`, as no entitlement is defined for this addon price.) | `300` (150 x 2)                                             |
        [Table 16: Entitlement values for `subscription.subscription_items[]`.]

        ##### 5. Determining final subscription entitlements

        ###### Case 1: `feature.levels[1].is_unlimited` is `false`

        In this scenario, the **final entitlement value** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `api_rate_limit` feature is the total entitlement value from the last column in Table 16, capped at `feature.levels[1].value`. The total entitlement value is 800 + 300 equaling 1100. However, `feature.levels[1].value` is `1000`, which is less than 1100. Therefore, the final entitlement is `1000`.

        ###### Case 2: `feature.levels[1].is_unlimited` is `true`

        In this scenario, `feature.levels[1].value` is disregarded, and the **final entitlement value** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) is not capped. In other words, the final entitlement value is `1100`.  

        ### Custom feature {#custom}

        #### Summary {#custom0}

        Consider a `feature` of type `custom`. Consider also a `subscription`, some of whose `subscription_items` correspond to `item_price`s (or `item`s) that have `entitlement`s to the feature.

        Looking at these entitlements, we first determine the entitlement value held by each `subscription_item` for this feature. The `subscription_entitlement` value is then set to the highest of these identified values.

        #### Example

        ##### 1. Feature record

        Consider the following `feature` record:

        |   `id`    |  `type`  |                        `description`                        |
        |-----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `support` | `custom` | `The form of after-sales support provided to the customer.` |
        [Table 17: `feature` records.]

        Suppose that the feature has `feature.levels[]` records as follows:

        | `levels[].level` | `levels[].value` |
        |------------------|------------------|
        | `0`              | `email`          |
        | `1`              | `chat`           |
        | `2`              | `call`           |
        [Table 18: `feature.levels[]` records.]

        ##### 2. Entitlement records

        Consider the following `entitlement` records for the `support` feature:

        |      `entity_id`      | `entity_type` | `value` |
        |-----------------------|---------------|---------|
        | `starter`             | `plan`        | `chat`  |
        | `starter-monthly-usd` | `plan_price`  | `email` |
        | `plus`                | `addon`       | `call`  |
        [Table 19: `entitlement` records for the `api_rate_limit` feature.]

        ##### 3. Subscription-items records

        Consider that a `subscription` with `id` `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` has the following `subscription.subscription_items[]` records:

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    | `quantity` |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|
        | `0`                          | `starter-monthly-usd` | `2`        |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `2`        |
        [Table 20: `subscription.subscription_items[]` records.]

        ##### 4. Subscription-item entitlements

        Chargebee Billing now determines the entitlement held by each `subscription_items[]` based on the entitlements defined in Table 19. This is shown in Table 21. For clarity, we've omitted the `quantity` column because it doesn't affect features with the `custom` `type`.

        | `subscription_items[]` index |    `item_price_id`    |                 Subscription-Item Entitlement Value (determined from Table )                 |
        |------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `0`                          | `starter-monthly-usd` | `email` (Matches the value of the plan price.)                                               |
        | `1`                          | `plus-monthly-usd`    | `call` (Inherited from the addon `plus`, as no entitlement is defined for this addon price.) |
        [Table 21: Entitlement values for `subscription.subscription_items[]`.]

        ##### 5. Determining final subscription entitlements

        ###### Case 1: Absence of a subscription-level override

        In this scenario, the **final entitlement** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `support` feature is the **highest** of all the subscription-item entitlement values, which in this case is `call`.

        ###### Case 2: With subscription-level override

        Suppose there's an `entitlement_override` added to the subscription for the feature, as shown below:

        |     `entity_id`     | `entity_type`  | `feature_id` | `value` |                         `expires_at`                          |
        |---------------------|----------------|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
        | `AzZjAiTl1btqS2lEj` | `subscription` | `support`    | `chat`  | `1695884985` (7 days from now, assuming today is 2023-09-21.) |
        [Table 22: `entitlement_override` record for the subscription and feature.]

        Given this override, the subscription's **final entitlement value** (`subscription_entitlement.value`) for the `support` feature will be `chat` until 2023-09-21 and `call` thereafter.

        Time Machine is a simulation feature which imitates the key
        characteristics, behaviours and functions of the billing configurations.
        It is a virtual time travelling tool which facilitates the integration
        testing process by carrying out subscription renewals, dunning, webhooks
        etc on a hypothetical time frame.


        You can use Time Machine in the test site to verify if the billing rules
        configured in your site adhere to your expectations before executing
        them in real time. This feature can be used in both API and UI versions.


        View this [doc](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/time-machine.html) for
        more details.


        **Note:** In order to use Time Machine via API , you need to first
        "enable" the Time Travel option which is available under **Settings** \>
        **Configure Chargebee** \> **Time Machine**.

        Unbilled charge represents the charges that are held by passing
        invoice_later in various operations such as update subscription, add
        charge, create subscription, etc. [Learn
        more.](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/unbilled-charges.html)


        If any invoice is to be created for a subscription all the unbilled
        charges associated with the subscription will be included in that
        invoice.


        If any invoice is to be created for a customer, all the unbilled charges
        associated with its subscriptions will be included in that invoice.


        Any automatic invoice creation like renewal, activation, etc., will
        include the unbilled charges.


        Subscriptions are invoiced at the start of every term based on the
        recurring items and charged immediately against the customer's credit
        card if 'auto_collection' is turned 'on', otherwise the resulting
        invoice will be created as 'Payment Due'.


        If consolidated invoicing is enabled, the charges during the
        subscription renewals/activations will be held and consolidated at the
        last renewal/activation that takes place on that particular day.

        The Usages API is used to record usage for metered item prices in a subscription. This API is only applicable when Automated Metered Billing is enabled in Chargebee.

        Metered items are those that are billed based on the service usage. Common examples include:

        * Internet data services.
        * SMS send/receive services.
        * API services that are billed for the number of API calls made, say, per month.



        An [item](/docs/api/items) is marked metered by setting its `metered` attribute as `true`. Only recurring items can be can be set as `metered`. Recurring items are those of `type` `plan` or `addon`. A subscription can have both metered and non-metered items. The usages API (described in this page), is used to add, retrieve and delete usages for the metered items in a subscription.

        #### Invoicing Metered Item Prices {#invoicing_usages_pcv2}

        While non-metered items are invoiced in a prepaid manner at the beginning of each billing cycle; for metered items, the charges are raised at the end of the billing term (postpaid). During the course of the billing period, [usages can be added](usages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_usage) as and when they occur. For a given `subscription_id` and `item_price_id`, there can be only one usage record for a specific `usage_date`. At the end of each term, the invoice is generated with `status` as `pending`. Any remaining usage records can continue to be added to the subscription until the invoice [closes automatically](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/metered_billing.html#configuring-metered-billing) or is [closed via an API call](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#close_a_pending_invoice). If a usage record has erroneous information and you want to correct it, [delete the usage](usages?prod_cat_ver=2#delete_a_usage) and add it again.  
        **Max Usages**   

        * The maximum number of usages that can be recorded for the entire lifetime of a subscription is 5000. [Contact Support](https://chargebee.freshdesk.com/support/home) if you want this limit to be increased for your site.
        * If there are no usages for an item price, the item price is not invoiced.

        This resource allows you to record usage events, which are essential for usage-based billing. These events track customer consumption and calculate charges based on actual usage. You can send usage data to Chargebee using two endpoints: [Ingest a Usage Event](usage_events#create_a_usage_event) for individual events and [Ingest Usage Events in Batch](usage_events#ingest_usages_in_batch) for bulk submissions.

        The usage event resource payload is schema-less, providing the flexibility to adapt to your unique business requirements. Because usage events are not directly tied to a pricing plan, this resource enables independent tracking of feature consumption. Events are processed and associated with relevant features as usage data. This information is used for billing alongside <entitlements>, <items>(such as plans or addons), or [item prices](item_prices) to generate invoices. This decoupling of usage data from the product catalog provides flexibility in defining and monetizing usage beyond predefined pricing models. Additionally, this API supports feature usage analytics, churn prediction, and other insights.
